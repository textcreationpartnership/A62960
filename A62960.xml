            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe God of our Fathers hath done great things for this his people, in the ſight of the Nations. We have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work God did in their dayes, how he did drive out the Heathen with his hand, and <hi>Planted</hi> them, how he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the people and caſt them out: for they got not the Land in poſſeſſion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm ſave them, but his right Hand and his Arm, and the light of his Countenance, becauſe he had a favour to them. Yea, the Lord hath given us his good Spirit to inſtruct us, and hath not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Manna from us, but hath turned this Wilderneſs into a <hi>Canaan,</hi> and here hath he given us <hi>Reſt</hi> (the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reſted longer) fourty years and more: and all this while hath he been feeding and leading of us, by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; of <hi>Aaron.</hi> It would fill a Volume, to declare in how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Lord hath dealt with us, as he did with his people in the dayes of old. He that hath ſaid, <hi>I will make the Wilderneſs a Pool of water, and the dry lands Springs of water, I will plant in the Wilderneſs a Cedar,</hi> hath in an eminent degree fulfilled that word before our eyes. And we may conclude, that the Lord intended ſome great thing, when he planted theſe Heavens, and laid the foundation of this Earth, and ſaid unto <hi>New-England</hi> (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Sion</hi>) <hi>Thou art my People:</hi> And what ſhould that be, if not that ſo a <hi>Scripture-Pattern of Reformation,</hi> as to <hi>Civil,</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> reſpects, might be here erected, as a <hi>Firſt fruits</hi> of that which ſhall in due time be accompliſhed the whole world throughout, in that day when there ſhall be one Lord, and his Name one over all the earth?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64014:3"/>
            <p>Upon all which accounts, our not anſwering Divine Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning us, hath the more of evil, and of dangerous conſequence in it. <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> in any people is a great provocation to the eyes of Gods glory, but much more in a people whom he hath brought under ſuch manifold Engagements to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as is to be affirmed of us, in theſe goings down of the Sun. It muſt be confeſſed to the praiſe of his glory, that the Lord is not yet wholly gone from us, and there are grounds of hope, that he will not leave us nor forſake us, at leaſt-wiſe that as yet it ſhall not be: For there are ſome (though alas! now but few) of <hi>the firſt Generation</hi> ſtill ſurviving, who went after the Lord into this Wilderneſs, when it was a Land not ſown, whoſe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs God doth remember; and it may be hoped, that there ſhall be Peace and Truth in their dayes. It muſt likewiſe be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that as for our <hi>Iſrael, the Leaders thereof,</hi> both in our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical ſtate, are in ſome meaſure faithful. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous evils when they break forth, are born witneſs againſt, and therefore the Lord will not impute them to the Land where they are committed. When did the Lord ever give up any people to utter deſtruction, but that firſt their Magiſtrates and Miniſters were become corrupt? Therefore as yet our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall not <hi>become heaps, and the Mountain of the Lords houſe as the high places of the forreſt.</hi> Alſo the Lord who was ſtill wont, as there were any <hi>beginnings of Apoſtacy</hi> in his people of old, to <hi>teſtifie againſt them by his Spirit in his Prophets,</hi> hath raiſed up thoſe in this Land, unto whom he hath given grace, and a Spirit of faithfulneſs to do the like, (witneſs the enſuing <hi>Sermon</hi>) which is a token for good.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, there are on the other hand awful Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may cauſe us to fear vvhat the end vvill be; O that vve vvere vviſe, that vve underſtood theſe things! We have been, and (through grace) to this day are, <hi>a people near unto the Lord;</hi> but in that reſpect, vve have the greater cauſe not to be ſecure. It is a very ſolemn Obſervation, vvhich I remember
<pb facs="tcp:64014:3"/>
               <hi>Commenius</hi> hath, ſpeaking of thoſe once-famous and glorious Churches in <hi>Bohemia, viZ.</hi> That they were <hi>nearer to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> then other Churches, by reaſon of a more <hi>pure Diſcipline</hi> by them owned and profeſſed; and therefore when <hi>Contentions</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacies</hi> prevailed amongſt them, the Lord poured down his righteous Diſpleaſures on them, and hath ſet them forth as ſad Examples before other Churches. Let us lay it to heart. And it greatly concerns us ſo to do, for that there are ſad evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our departures from the Lord in a woful degree, and awful ſymptomes of the Lords departure from us. Churches are not wont to caſt off the good wayes of God at once, but gradually, it may be more generations then one may paſs away firſt; ſo neither doth the God of all patience and grace caſt off them, but in a gradual way of procedure. How many <hi>ſtands</hi> did the <hi>glory of the Lord</hi> make, e're it was quite removed, never more to return in the former luſtre? Is it not ſo with this people? In what place can vve behold the glory of the <hi>firſt Temple?</hi> Do not the ancient men that have ſeen the <hi>firſt Houſe,</hi> weep over this? If vve be not at all ſenſible of theſe things, our caſe is no leſs deſperate then <hi>Ephraims,</hi> vvhen gray hairs vvere upon him, but he knew it nor. That people vvho vvere newly come out of the hands of thoſe that ſometime <hi>ſaid to their Souls, Bow down, that we may go over;</hi> and vvhoſe preſent great Intereſt vvas to carry on <hi>Temple work,</hi> vvhen arrived at the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace and Liberty (and in many other reſpects circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as vve are this day) ſoon forgat their main and true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, being under the powerful and prevailing influence of a Worldly degenerating Spirit; and yet they ſaid, <hi>Wherein ſhall we return?</hi> How many vvith us, are with the ſame Spirit making the ſame enquiry? The Reverend Author of this <hi>Sermon,</hi> law it leſs needful to inſiſt on the Anſwer to that, or to ſpeak much by vvay of <hi>Conviction,</hi> becauſe that vvould have been <hi>Actum agere,</hi> ſince God did help that Worthy Servant of his, vvho Preached the <hi>Election-Sermon,</hi> but the year immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
<pb facs="tcp:64014:4"/>faithfully, fully, and convincingly to inlarge on that Argument. Moreover (though ſome deny it) it is a generall Conceſſion amongſt us, that vve are in a <hi>declining Apoſtatizing ſtate,</hi> and therefore that <hi>Reformation</hi> is neceſſary. Our ſins teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie againſt us, and as for our iniquities vve know them: And yet vvhen it cometh to particulars, vve ſhall finde thoſe calling that <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Defection,</hi> vvhich the Lord Jeſus (I doubt not) will own for Truth and laudable Conſtancy another day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently vvould have that put in practiſe for <hi>Reformation,</hi> which Chriſt vvill never own. <hi>Browniſm, Libertiniſm, or undue ſtraitning and confining the grace of that Covenant,</hi> vvhich God hath made vvith our Fathers, is far from being the <hi>Intereſt of N.E</hi> and moſt of all from being the Intereſt of <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony.</hi> Were our now glorified Fathers (<hi>Winthrope, Dudley, Cotton, Hooker,</hi> vvith the reſt of thoſe bleſſed Worthies, vvho vvere the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under God, of laying the Foundation both of our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical State) here amongſt us, they would ſay ſo. Let their Manuſcripts and printed Books, which they have left behind them to ſucceeding generations, come in for Witneſſes; and witneſs the <hi>Platform of Diſcipline,</hi> agreed on by the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of all the Churches in this Colony, yea of all theſe <hi>United Colonies.</hi> Well did our bleſſed <hi>Mitchell</hi> alſo give in his Teſtimony, when ſpeaking in the Name of the Lord, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like ſolemn Occaſion as this Sermon was Preached on; <hi>Do not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>wrong and marre an excellent work and Profeſsion, by mixing and weaving in ſpurious Principles and Practices, as thoſe of</hi> Separation, Anabaptiſm, Morellian (Anarchical) <hi>Confuſion, and licentious Toleration. If any would ſecretly twiſt in, and eſpouſe ſuch things as theſe, and make theſe part of our Intereſt, we muſt needs renounce it as none of our Cauſe, no part of the End and Deſign of the Lords faithful Servants, when they followed him into this land which was not ſown. Separation and Anabaptiſm are monted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders and ſeeming Friends, but ſecret fatal Enemies to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as</hi> Paul <hi>in a caſe not much unlike,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10—15. <hi>In this
<pb facs="tcp:64014:4"/>work here on foot, there was a good Foundation laid,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt as the onely Law-giver in his Church, and Reformation deſigned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will, and Apoſtolical Pattern. If you ſhould build the Hay and Stubble of ſuch things as thoſe, then verily (though ſincere perſons will be ſaved, and the main of the work may be ſaved and revived at laſt) yet ſooner or later, there will come a fire that will burn up this Stubble, and then your poor Leaders, that would have led you the right way, may be remembred when it is too late. Do not under pretence of avoiding Corruption, run into ſinfull Separation from any of the true Churches of God, (and what is good therein) or from the Children of the Covenant. Prize and hold faſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to you and yours.</hi> Thus that bleſſed man. It doth then concern us to take heed, that we do not miſtake as to that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> which is, and the <hi>Anaſtacy</hi> which ought to be amongſt us. And ſurely it is a ſafe and undoubted Principle, which runs through that practical and profitable Diſcourſe, to the which theſe lines are prefixed, <hi>viz. That the great Apoſtacy of</hi> New-England <hi>is in reſpect of the Spirits of men, and general decay as to the power of godlineſs.</hi> Were there a <hi>thorough Reformation</hi> in this matter, we need not fear any evil, but without this, no other <hi>Reformation</hi> will continue the Lords Preſence with us. The <hi>firſt</hi> Deſign of <hi>New-England</hi> was purely <hi>Religious,</hi> but now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to eſpouſe, and are eagerly purſuing another, even a <hi>Worldly</hi> Intereſt. Is not this the grand Procuring Cauſe of former and preſent Blaſtings on the fruits of the earth? And is it not for this ſin, that the Lord is at this day ſeeming to ſpeak as if the Trade of this poor Country ſhould be ruined? Theſe are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn humbling Providences, which God would have us take notice of. Verily the Lord ſmiteth us, in that which hath been our <hi>Idol,</hi> i.e. <hi>the World,</hi> that ſo he may put us in minde of our firſt and true Intereſt; yea, that we may <hi>remember whence we are fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works.</hi>

            <p>Reader, The enſuing <hi>Sermon</hi> needs no Letters Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, eſpecially not from ſo mean a pen as writeth this. The <hi>Vote</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64014:5"/>paſſed in that Honoured Aſſembly to whom it was preached, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Author to print what he had preached, is Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation ſufficient. The acceptance alſo which this Sermon when delivered found with all good men, though of different perſwaſions, is an evidence, that the Preacher was under a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial guidance and influence from the Spirit of Chriſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. It was the Advice of one of the Ancients, that in Reading Books, we ſhould regard <hi>non ſcientiam ſed ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem:</hi> if we reſpect either of theſe, the following Diſcourſe commends it ſelf to the Reader; for that a judicious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Spirit doth breathe in it and through it, no underſtanding Chriſtian can deny.</p>
            <p>Now the good Lord, who was with <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> becauſe he walked in the <hi>firſt wayes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> his father, grant that we may be kept faithful to <hi>the firſt Principles of New-England,</hi> and that not onely as to our <hi>Church ſtate,</hi> in reſpect whereof, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to profeſs and practiſe <hi>the Congregational-way of Church-Government,</hi> as inſtituted by Chriſt, and held forth in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of Truth, but alſo as to our <hi>Civil-ſtate,</hi> which hath been built upon principles of Righteouſneſs and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> the Laws and people of Chriſt being eſpecially regarded therein, that ſo <hi>Holineſs unto the Lord,</hi> may be upon us in all reſpects. Then may we expect the continuance both of our Civil and Sacred liberties. That it may be ſo, is the earneſt prayer of him, who hath great reaſon to eſteem himſelf,</p>

               <hi>GOD who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto us by his Son.</hi> This Book, wherein we finde our Text, it hath this peculiar unto it, that it bears the <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Inſcription</hi> of this great <hi>Prophet,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And indeed it bears a very lively impreſſion of his <hi>Image</hi> (as it were) in the <hi>Frontiſpiece</hi> of it, drawn out to the Life by a twofold deſcription of him, in his <hi>Perſon, Office</hi> and <hi>Work, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16— as alſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book, reſpecting both the Matter of it, and the Manner of delivery, in the Myſtery and Majeſty of it. It hath alſo this peculiar Eminency and Excellency, that it contains a <hi>Syſteme,</hi> or the Sum of all Goſpel Propheſie. It is a <hi>Prophetical Revelation</hi> of all Myſteries of Divine Diſpenſation, in the whole Series and Succeſſion of it, in every Age and Generation, and in every ſtate and condition of the Church; reſpecting both the Propagation of his Kingdome, and the deſtruction of his Enemies, untill all the whole Myſtery of God be finiſhed, and Time ſhall be no longer, (at leaſt) untill the laſt and utmoſt Prophetical Period. It is the laſt great and general <hi>Propheſie,</hi> which doth compleat the <hi>Canon</hi> of Holy Writ, intimated <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Therefore bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>beloved</hi> and <hi>boſome</hi> Diſciple, and laſt Apoſtle, is the Miniſter of this Revelation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. therefore the Dedication of it is from <hi>John,</hi> unto the <hi>Seven Churches in Aſia,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 4. <hi>John to the Seven Churches in Aſia.</hi> This general or indefinite <hi>Dedication,</hi> makes way for the particular <hi>Inſcription</hi> of an Epiſtle unto the ſeveral Angels of thoſe Churches, in the 2d and 3d Chapters. Our Text lyes in the firſt of theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64014:6"/>Epiſtles, inſcribed, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angel of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> Chap. 2.1. I ſhall not detain you with any diſcourſe concerning the Scituation of the City, or Typical Relation of the Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> nor ſtay upon an Artificial Reſolution of the Context, by an Analytical Expoſition of the Epiſtle; which are vulgar with Expoſitors. The way to our Text is eaſie and open: it lyes in that part of the Epiſtle which is <hi>Narrative.</hi> The words (as to Mode of expreſſion) they are <hi>Monitory,</hi> and withall highly <hi>Imperative</hi> or Commanding. The duty commanded, it is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (according to direction given) unto a full and through Reſtitution from that Declenſion and Defection in Religion, which that Church was fallen into. In order hereunto, three things are propoſed in the words, as parts of the work and duty commanded to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An awakening ſight and ſenſe of their declenſion and defection;</hi> (in theſe words) <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> The word <hi>Remember</hi> here, it imports an awakening, convincing Remembrance: it is often uſed in Scripture to expreſs a conſcience and conviction of ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61, 63. — <hi>from whence thou art fallen,</hi> or elapſed, ſlidden, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden; plainly ſignifying, Backſliding and Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A penitential Confeſſion of, and humiliation under the ſin of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion and defection;</hi> in this word, <hi>Repent.</hi> It ſignifies Repentance in the proper act of it, which is <hi>a ſad and ſolemn recognition of, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon our paſt evil actions, with Confeſſion and Humiliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reformation;</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Do the firſt werks:</hi> which ſignifie <hi>Reformation</hi> in the proper act of it, poſitive practical Reformation; — <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, repent, and do the firſt works.</hi> It is as if our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſaid unto this Angel and Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Although thou haſt been commendable (and I have commended thee) for thy ſtrong and ſtedfaſt perſeverance, by the great labour of thy Faith and Patience, in the ſincere, pure, and powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, reſpecting both Doctrine and Worſhip, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Zeal againſt Hereſie and Apoſtacy, Hereticks and Apoſtates, and that alſo with extraordinary Courage and Conſtancy, under many great Temptations, and much and great Tribulation: and although thou haſt been extraordinarily beautified and bleſſed with my Preſence, in the exerciſe of my Kingly and Prophetical Office; though thou haſt been Eminent, yea Excellent among the Churches; and although thou doſt yet hold up thy Profeſſion in the external Form of it, and doſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill deſerve ſome Commendation: Yet know, O <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that thou art fallen; thou haſt leſt thy firſt love, thou haſt loſt thy firſt life, thou haſt deſerted thy firſt works; thou art not what thou haſt been,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64014:6"/>thou art fallen into a ſtate, frame, and way of backſliding and Apoſtacy. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and labour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy ſelf ſpeedily from thy declenſion and defection, and to retrive thy priſtine and primitive Profeſſion and practiſe of Religion, unto its former internal and ſpiritual Life and Power, from which it is chiefly that thou art fallen, or elſe I will withdraw my gracious Preſence from thee, and come unto thee quickly in my wrath, and deveſt thee of all thy Priviledges, Church-Order, Ordinances and Adminiſtrations, of the Dignity and Beauty, yea of the very Being of a Church, by the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Candleſtick: <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen,</hi> &amp;c. The words thus plainly opening themſelves unto us, afford us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <label>Doct.</label> That it is the preſent, and moſt important Duty and Concernment of any Collapſing or Back-ſliding Church or Churches, to labour (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Awakening, Convincing ſight and ſenſe (or under an Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conviction) of their Declenſion and Defection) unto a full and through Reſtitution from it, by Repentance and Reformation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Text it ſelf is ſo good a Doctrine, it doth ſeem needleſs to invert the terms of it. It is enough to ſay, That it is the work and duty of any Church or Churches, which are in the like declining and decaying eſtate, which this Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in, to Remember from whence they are fallen, to repent, and to do their firſt works. It is the preſent, inſtant, and moſt important duty, it is indeed all the work and duty which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth commend and propound unto, and preſs upon this Church in this whole Epiſtle, and ſo unto and upon all other Churches in the like ſtate: and he doth propoſe it plainly and fully in all the parts of it, that they might have a full and diſtinct underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and direction unto it; that they might be through and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in the purſuance and performance of it. He propoſeth it alſo as a moſt important duty and concernment, as that upon which depended their very Being and Standing as a Candleſtick amongſt the Candleſticks, as a Church among the Churches. He propoſeth it as a work and duty which they had yet great advantage and encouragement to labour in, under the powerful exerciſe of his Kingly and Prophetical Office; and therefore he repreſents himſelf unto this declining Church (for their encouragement) as <hi>walking amidſt the golden Candleſticks,</hi> and <hi>bolding the Stars in his right hand;</hi> that is, in his full and whole Sufficiency to uphold his Church, in its Conſtitution, and in the pure and powerful Adminiſtration both of Doctrine and Worſhip; and by a powerful and effectual diſpenſation of his Spirit and Grace, to reſtore and recover
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64014:7"/>them from their preſent declenſion and defection. He alſo propoſeth it as a work and duty requiring preſent, inſtant diſpatch, which muſt be quickly done: and he preſſeth it, upon penalty of Unchurching Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo upon peril of groſs, open, total, and final Apoſtacy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the removal of the Candleſtick; and finally moving of them hereunto, by a great and moſt gracious Promiſe of perſeverance in caſe of obedience, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Thus you ſee how full both the Text and the Context are of this Doctrine. And this is alſo the great work and duty, which God did propound and preſs by all his Prophets, upon the Church of old, in their <hi>declining and decaying ſtate,</hi> which for many Ages together they were in. It was Gods great work by the Miniſtry of thoſe great Prophets, whoſe Propheſies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, to convince them of their <hi>Back-ſlidings and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> and to perſwade them to return by <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> The general word of the Lord by thoſe Prophets, it was <hi>Turn, O back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children; Return, O backſliding Iſrail—Repent, and turn ye; Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 14, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.11. <hi>Ezek</hi> 14.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1. It was the great work of thoſe Prophets, to bring back this people unto God: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Yet he ſent Prophets to them, to bring them again to the Lord.</hi> It was the general cry of all the Prophets, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Turn ye now unto me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets cried, Turn ye now</hi>—Obſerve, Repentance and Reformation it was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cry of the Prophets to that backſliding people: whence it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it was their great and main work and duty, to Repent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. I might further <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> argue, and prove this Doctrine from the ſuitableneſs of this work and duty, unto a <hi>back ſliding</hi> people, (it is the proper work of ſuch a people;) as alſo from the neceſſity of it, and from the good and benefit of it, and from all <hi>Topicks</hi> of Reaſons and Arguments: but it being of undeniable, and therefore of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable verity, I ſhall take leave (for brevity's ſake) to pretermit what might or ought to be ſpoken for the more full <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Explication</hi> thereof, and proceed unto <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein, I ſhall apply my ſelf unto the Churches, and unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo far (at leaſt) as they may be ſpoken unto in one <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi> and I ſhall addreſs my ſelf unto You, as in the Name, ſo in the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by this threefold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. (1.) <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> (2.) <hi>Repent.</hi> (3.) <hi>Do the firſt works.</hi> Theſe Epiſtles, and ſo theſe Exhortations,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64014:7"/>were directed to the Churches: Chriſt requires and calls for the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> I am emboldened therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and preſs this general Exhortation, unto and upon the Churches, becauſe the Text, the Doctrine, the Occaſion and the Opportunity do lead me unto it; and becauſe I have alſo thought, that God doth call me unto it, in the Improvement of ſuch a Text, upon ſuch an Occaſion, in ſuch an Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> I. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> Let this be an Awakening Watch-word from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto theſe ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering Churches in this Midnight of deep Security, wherein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality both of Chriſtians and Churches, are diſpoſing, yea compoſing of themſelves to ſleep, by indulging themſelves unto carnal reſt and eaſe, ſhutting their eyes againſt all awakening diſcoveries, and ſtopping their ears againſt all awakening voices; yea, although it be the voice of their <hi>Beloved:</hi> as the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh, it is the voice of my Beloved that knocketh—I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Surely an Awakening Watch-word is then moſt neceſſary and ſeaſonable; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more, then in ſleepy and ſleeping Times, when <hi>Judicial Security</hi> ſeemeth to be both one of the greateſt <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> of the Times; when God in juſt Judgement is <hi>pouring out of a ſpirit of deep ſleep, and cloſing the eyes of men,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. and <hi>giving a ſpirit of ſlumber, Rom.</hi> 11.8. No doubt but this Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was deeply ſecure, under her deep declenſion: Spiritual declenſion doth incline both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Churches unto Security; whilſt the wiſe Virgins lamps want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trimming, and the fooliſh Virgins lamps were gone out, <hi>they all ſlumbered and ſlept,</hi> Mat. 25.5. as Chriſtians or Churches decline, ſo they grow ſecure, and fall aſleep. The Church of old, both <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> were moſt prodigiouſly ſecure in the depth of their Apoſtacy: the Prophets did propheſie Peace, and the people did promiſe themſelves peace, untill they had conſummated both their Apoſtacy and Miſery, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10, 16. Truly thus it is (too much) with us, the more ſinful we grow, the more ſecure; the generality of the Generation growing more and more ſenſleſs, ſupine, ſtupid, ſottiſh in their ſecurity. Hence, although we hear all kinde of Awakening Voices, and ſee many Awakening Sights; though the voice of God doth <hi>Cry</hi> by his Word, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.4. yea though it doth <hi>Roar</hi> by his Works, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. yet we are not awakened: Though there be a grievous and general Complaint and Cry of the great &amp; Crying ſins of the Times, yea
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64014:8"/>although our ſins do teſtifie againſt us, unto our very faces, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.5. though our own wickedneſs doth correct us, and our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings reprove us, that we are forced to ſee and acknowledge, that <hi>it is an evil thing and bitter, that we have forſaken the Lord our God, and that his fear is not in us,</hi> Jer. 2.19. though we begin to labour and to languiſh under the ſad and lamentable effects and conſequences of our ſins; and are ſenſible, <hi>that our tranſgreſſions and iniquities are upon us,</hi> and that <hi>we pine away,</hi> and are likely to <hi>periſh in them,</hi> Ezek 33.10. yea, although we our ſelves, in our moſt ſolemn Addreſſes unto Heaven, do complain and cry out unto God of our ſins, iniquities, Backſlidings and Apoſtacies, and verbally and formally expreſs deep Conviction, yet we are not awakened nor convinced, but ſenſleſs and ſecure ſtill: our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Solemnities performed (by many) but as Solemn Formalities, do lull them to ſleep in the deeper Security, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. Truly, the more means of Conviction, the more a ſecure people are ſometimes hardened againſt Conviction. Security, it is a great hinderance, both unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and <hi>Reformation,</hi> therefore Chriſt doth propoſe this as the firſt part of the work, <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</hi> So to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3.18. <hi>Anoint thine eyes with eye ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee</hi>—(that is) See and be ſenſible of thy defection. God hath made it the work of divers of his faithful Servants, whom he hath of late ſent and ſet to ſpeak upon this Occaſion in this general Aſſembly, to Awaken, and to Couvince, to Plead with us in a way of Conviction, to <hi>Cry aloud, not to ſpare, to lift their voices like a Trumpet, to ſhew</hi> New-England <hi>their tranſgreſſions, and this people their ſins,</hi> Iſa. 58.2. and ſurely untill we are thus awakened and convinced, there will be no hope of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> II. <hi>Repent.</hi> So remember from whence thou art fallen, as to <hi>Repent.</hi> It muſt be a <hi>Penitential Remembrance,</hi> ſuch a remembrance as doth both move, and lead to Repentance. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61. <hi>Then ſhalt thou remember thy wayes, and be aſhamed:</hi> ver. 63. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame:</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20 43. When and where there is ſuch an awakening, convincing Remembrance, there will be Repentance. Surely God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and calls for a deep, thorough, general Repentance: Repentance in all the parts of it, the full exerciſe of it, the whole work of it, unto all the fruits, effects, and ends of it, expreſſed in Confeſſion, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Humiliation, Supplication, from a right Spirit of Repentance. God calls for heart-breaking, heart-rending Repentance, <hi>Jol</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rend your hearts, and not your garments.</hi> God expects to hear <hi>New-England</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64014:8"/>(as <hi>Ephraim</hi>) bemoaning himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Surely, after I was turned, I repented, after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, yea even confounded.</hi> It is impoſſible that we ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, except we thus Repent; for the foundation of the whole work of Reformation is laid in Repentance, the work of Reformation is wrought in Repentance: and therefore our Lord Jeſus Chriſt layes the burthen of all the work upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> in the Text, <hi>Except thou repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> III. <hi>Do the firſt works.</hi> So remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, as <hi>to do the firſt works;</hi> that is, <hi>Reform.</hi> And here chiefly lyes my preſent buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> in preſſing this part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: And the rather I ſhall take leave to inſiſt a while upon it, as a ſuitable and ſeaſonable word, becauſe we have been <hi>Originally a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, and a Reformed people</hi> a people ſeparated and ſet apart by God, to be the Subject of a very great and glorious Work of Reformation. <hi>Reformation</hi> hath been the deſign of <hi>New-England,</hi> and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it is the Profeſſion of <hi>New-England.</hi> This work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it hath been (eſpecially by this Generation) (not onely) much neglected, but even (almoſt) utterly deſerted, by a general defection and declenſion, which we are fallen into; ſo that we are now become a declining, and declined people. There hath been, and there is a general Complaint and Cry for want of Reformation, it is generally confeſſed and acknowledged, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of a ſpeedy, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Reformation, and that without it we are an undone people. We have in our publick Solemnities made many ſolemn Vows and Promiſes of Reformation unto God, wherein, we have too much, <hi>flattered him with our lips, and lied unto him with our tongues, whilſt our hearts have not been ſtedfaſt with him:</hi> there is yet therefore an utter, total neglect and defect of Reformation; no kinde, no degree of Reformation, as little, and (in ſome reſpects) leſs hope and probability thereof, then ever before: and truly, without ſpeedy Reformation, our defection is likely to prove irreparable, and irrecoverable, ſin and ſinners growing every day more and more incorrigible, and incurable, and the heart of the Generation more and more corrupted with a Spirit of Profaneneſs and Apoſtacy, and <hi>ſo bent to back ſliding,</hi> Hoſ. 11.7. inſomuch that it is too likely to be a <hi>perpetual backſliding.</hi> And that which is yet more then all, and moſt of all preſſing, it is the danger that we are in of being given up <hi>juſtly and judicially</hi> by God, unto a ſpirit, frame, and way of Back-ſliding and Apoſtacy, if we do not ſpeedly reform. <hi>Haſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Ephraine back ſlideth, like a back-ſliding-heifer — Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Pſal. 81.11. <hi>So be gave them up to their own harts luſts.</hi> Deut.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64014:9"/>32.20. <hi>I will hide my face from them; I will ſee what their end will be:</hi> (q.d.) I will have no more to do with them in a way of grace and mercy, I will leave them to themſelves, to finiſh their Apoſtacy, to fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, I will ſee what miſerable, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end they will bring themſelves unto: and truly, if ſo, then wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, we ſhall ſoon deſtroy our ſelves. But yet, God is in mercy <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may be gracious,</hi> Iſa. 30.13. and therefore, that which God is yet calling for, looking for, (yea to ſpeak after the manner of men) that which God is longing for, it is out Reformation, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, wilt thou not be made clean? when ſhall it once be?</hi> Theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may move our Attention unto this Exhortation. And here I ſhall take leave to ſpeak unto Reformation in general, and ſo not onely unto a reſtitution from our defection, but the progreſs of the Work of Reformation. God expects not onely that we ſhould <hi>do our firſt works,</hi> but that <hi>our laſt works ſhould be more then our firſt,</hi> which was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Rev. 2.19. I ſhall therefore propoſe ſome general duties to be laboured in, in order unto Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and endeavour (as God ſhall help) to ſuit my Diſcourſe herein unto the preſent condition of this people, and theſe Churches.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It ſhould be our labour to get a new Heart and new Spirit.</hi> This is the life and ſpirit of the work of Reformation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn your ſelves from your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine—and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit: for why will ye die, O horſe of Iſrael?</hi> When God doth work reforming grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Covenant with his people, upon terms of Reformation, he doth firſt take away the corrupt, hard, impenitent, unbelieving, backſliding, apoſtatizing heart, and gives them <hi>a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> Jer. 31.33. &amp; 32.39. Ezek. 11.19. &amp; 36.26. The <hi>foundation</hi> of the work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> it muſt be laid in a <hi>new heart,</hi> becauſe the original of our defection and Apoſtacy, it is in the heart: and therefore God every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where complaineth of that backſliding people, that they had an <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed heart,</hi> Jer. 9.26. <hi>a whoriſh heart,</hi> Ezek. 6.9. that <hi>their heart was ſet upon their iniquity,</hi> Hoſ. 4.8. Truly, ſo it is, the very heart of <hi>New-England</hi> is changed, and exceedingly corrupted with the ſins of the Times: there is a Spirit of Profaneneſs, a Spirit of Pride, a Spirit of Worldlineſs, a Spirit of Senſuality, a Spirit of Gainſaying and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, a Spirit of Libertiniſm, a Spirit of Carnality, Formality, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and Spiritual Idolatry in the Worſhip of God.

               </gap>ed unto, and with the ſins of the Times, thoſe ſins are even rooted and grounded in the Spirit of the Generation, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The ſin of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64014:9"/>Judah—it is graven upon the table of their heart,</hi> ſo that there is no hope of Reformation, except we make us a new heart, and a new ſpirit. And truly this is the reaſon that we do not reform, that we cannot reform, though we do promiſe and vow Reformation unto God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. <hi>This people have well ſaid, O that there were ſuch an heart in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (q.d.) the great thing which this people want is an heart: Truly, ſo the great thing which <hi>New-England</hi> doth want, it is a new Heart, and a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Here then we muſt begin; and in order hereunto,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All ſincere Chriſtians muſt begin this work of Heart-reformation, by labouring to recover your Souls out of your Spiritual Declenſions, in grace, and in the life and power of godlineſs.</hi> This Spiritual Declenſion, it is in the <hi>firſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>ſtrict</hi> and proper ſenſe, that <hi>having of our firſt love,</hi> reproved in the Context, and therefore reſtitution from this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Declenſion, it is in the <hi>firſt moſt ſtrict and proper ſenſe, Doing of our firſt works,</hi> commended in the Text: and therefore ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are firſt, and moſt properly concerned in this duty of <hi>doing of their firſt works.</hi> How, generally and deeply Chriſtians are thus declined, both their hearts and lives do ſadly teſtifie. It is the great and general complaint of all ſenſible Chriſtians, O their decayes, and declenſions! hence little of the life and activity of grace, hardly enough to evidence the ſincerity of it, clearly and comfortably, either to themſelves or others; little of the life of Obedience, either in duties of Religion or Righteouſneſs; much Carnality, Formality, Hypocriſie in the Worſhip of God, both in publick, private, and in ſeeret, in all their Converſe and Communion both with God and Saints, their Souls languiſhing under a Spiritual Conſumption, and <hi>thoſe things which remain, even ready to die, Rev</hi> 3.2. It is true firſt of Chriſtians, then of Churches (in this ſenſe) That there is a univerſal deadneſs upon the hearts of Churches, hence great unprofitableneſs and unfruitfulneſs under all Ordinances, ſin more unmortified then ever, their hearts and lives deeply corrupted with the ſins of the Times, and many Chriſtians fallen into a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous way of Communion with, and Conformity unto the wicked World: and all this appearing upon ſome of thoſe, whoſe firſt life, love, ſincerity, purity and eminency in grace and godlineſs, was ſometimes a Beauty unto theſe Churches. <hi>O how is our gold become dim? and our fine gold changed?</hi> Lam. 4.1. <hi>How is our ſilver become droſs, and our wine mined with water?</hi> Iſa. 1.22. How are <hi>Zions Nazarites</hi> changed in their viſage? <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.7. How are the faces the Countenance, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of many Chriſtians changed? O Chriſtians, what ſhall we ſay? what ſhall we do? what will become of us? yea, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64014:10"/>of Religion in this next ſucceeding generation? If you live and die under your declenſions, as truly many Chriſtians are likely to do, being fallen into ſuch deep ſecurity under their declenſions, that they are not like to be awakened, untill the Cry be made at Midnight, <hi>The Bridegroom cometh,</hi> and muſt beſtir themſelves very hard to trim their Lamps, in time, to enter in with him. O Chriſtians, <hi>It is your Spiritual Declenſion that is the main root of the degeneracy of this Noble Vine,</hi> Jer. 2.21. It is your leaving of your firſt love, which doth make way for the removal of the Candleſtick; your Spiritual declenſion will lead the way unto, and lay the foundation for, the general and total defection of theſe Churches in ſucceeding generations: therefore, as the defection hath been in part begun by your declenſion; ſo the work of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it muſt be begun by your <hi>reſtitution.</hi> It is impoſſible that ever theſe Churches ſhould be reſtored unto their firſt Spiritual proſperity, and flouriſhing ſtate, unleſs Chriſtians do firſt recover their firſt love, life, ſincerity, fervency, purity, activity, eminency in the exerciſe of grace, and in the performance of duty, and in all practical piety, both in heart and life. O how can you hope to lye down in your Graves with peace and comfort, before you have done what in you lyeth in the Work of Reformation? How can you die in peace, under your Spiritual declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and thereby leave Religion decaying and dying, and theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and this Generation, your poor Poſterity, ſinking under a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and total defection? Sure, in vain, and fruſtrate will be all your prayers, deſires, hopes of a Reformation, except that you Chriſtians do thus begin, and lay the foundation of the work in your own hearts before you die.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The work of Heart-reformation, or making of a new heart, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Converſion, and Regeneration.</hi> This is the moſt full and proper ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Make ye a new heart, and new ſpirit, for why will ye die?</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</hi> It is a Call to the unconverted: when God doth reſtore his people from any deep and general defection, and renew his Covenant with them, he doth promiſe, and actually pour out abundance of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, and ſo revive and renew the work of Converſion. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you; I will take the flony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh: I will put my Spirit within you.</hi>— Let me be hold to ſay, If ever theſe Churches be throughly recovered, it will be, it muſt be by ſuch a diſpenſation of converting grace, unto an unconverted genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is Unregeneracy, that is the radical and total degeneracy of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64014:10"/>any generation, whereby it is wholly turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange Vine, unto the Lord. Here will be our deepeſt, and moſt dangerous defection, and that which will prove inevitably ruining unto theſe Churches, unleſs the Lord have mercy upon us. O our unbelief, and diſobedience unto the Goſpel, our rejection of Chriſt and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome! It is <hi>a moſt ſad and lamentable ſign,</hi> that theſe Churches, and Religion, are falling into an irreparable, irrecoverable decay, That there are ſo <hi>many of the generation growing up under the Miniſtry of the Word, and the improvement of all means of grace, in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregeneracy,</hi> under the prevailing power of Spiritual Apoſtacy and (as we have cauſe to fear) under a dreadful diſpenſation of divine Juſtice, by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Plagues and Judgements, being juſtly given up by God, unto a ſpirit, frame, and way of unprofitableneſs under a <hi>Judicial Miniſtry,</hi> ſent <hi>to make their heart fat, leſt they ſhould be converted,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10— O it is a fearful word, <hi>Leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and be healed.</hi> Obſerve, there is no help, no healing for any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the work of <hi>Converſion</hi> ceaſe amongſt them. Truly, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of very ſad Conſideration unto us, that the work of <hi>Converſion</hi> doth fail, and is failing more and more, in many (if not) in moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: although we have cauſe, with thankfulneſs, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Preſence and Power of the Spirit of God (ſo far) with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that there is yet ſome fruit of their labour appearing in the work of Converſion; but alas! not with proportion unto the great increaſe of the generation. O how rarely do we hear of a ſound work of Converſion, held forth with full and clear demonſtration of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of it! O how few ſuch Converts are there, as do evidence their Converſion by a powerful, practical Profeſſion of Religion? Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there are growing up in their Ignorance, Atheiſm, Unbelief, and Profaneneſs, who receive no impreſſion at all by the Word of God; and many others who do receive ſome degrees of common grace, who yet fall away by Spiritual Apoſtacy, who prove either vain, profane Profeſſors, or cloſe Hypocrites, or groſs Apoſtates. Truly, unleſs God is infinite Mercy revive and uphold the work of Converſion, there will be no hope, we ſhall periſh under this our Spiritual Apoſtacy, which is begun: for if the work of Converſion fail, all the ſins of the Times will be multiplied and aggravated; and unconverted ſinners will be in juſt Judgement given up to God, unto the power of thoſe ſins, ſo that our ſins will become our plagues, and thoſe incurable. O that all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſinners might be moved, to wait earneſtly upon God in the improvement of all means for converting grace, and bemoan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64014:11"/>before God under their Unregeneracy, Impanitency, Unbelief, then there would be hope in our end, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.17, 18. <hi>There is hope in thine end, ſaith the Lord</hi>—It follows, <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning himſelf thus—Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned:</hi> the onely hope which was, and which yet remains in the End of this people, it ariſeth from the reviving of the work of Converſion amongſt them; this ſhall be their reſurrection. And this ſeems to be a promiſe of that glorious diſpenſation of converting grace, which ſhall be effectual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their laſt Converſion: This hope there is yet in our end, that the work of Converſion ſhall yet have a powerful progreſs in theſe Churches; and then <hi>we ſhall return, and revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine.</hi> Hoſ. 14.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In order unto the promotion and progreſs of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we muſt renew our Covenant with God.</hi> By <hi>Covenant,</hi> here underſtand the <hi>Covenant of Grace, as it is conſtituted and confirmed, and ſavingly diſpenſed in, by, and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the onely Mediator thereof, together with all the Means both of the viſible and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſpenſation thereof, in a way of holy Communion with God and Saints.</hi> That Covenant whereby <hi>God is our God, and we his People.</hi> Now this Covenant, it is alwayes in ſome degree or other violated and broken, by defection and apoſtacy; and therefore God calleth it, <hi>Forſaking of his Covenant,</hi> Jer. 22.9. <hi>Breaking of his Covenant,</hi> Jer. 31.32. <hi>Trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Covenant,</hi> Hoſ. 6.7. Hence, when God doth reject any people for their Apoſtacy, he is ſaid to break his Covenant with them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.10. Hence alſo we reade, that the people of God have alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the work of Reformation, by renewing their Covenant with God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.3. And when God gives reforming grace, he alwayes renews his Covenant with his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33— God ſingled out our Fathers, and ſeparated them unto himſelf, in a more peculiar manner, as a people with whom he did <hi>particularly,</hi> &amp; as it were <hi>perſonally</hi> renew his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and more amply and <hi>explicitly</hi> confirm it, that in renewing of it, he might more fully reveal it, and reſtore it unto the more pure and primitive way of Adminiſtration, according to his own Inſtitution. We cannot ſay when, where, or with whom, God hath in more ſpecial grace and favour renewed his <hi>Covenant,</hi> that they might be a ſpecial people unto himſelf, above all people, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6— Therefore if we hope for the confirmation of Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, it is our duty, after our defection, to renew it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the work of ſincere Chriſtians, who are actually and perſonally in Covenant with God, (who yet have (by the omiſſion of Covenant-duties,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64014:11"/>and by the commiſſion of Covenant-breaking ſins) walked looſely, remiſsly, unconſtantly, unſteadfaſtly, and in all reſpects very unworthily, under Gods holy Covenant) to renew your Covenant with God, by the renewed ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Souls unto God, under the Soul-binding Obligations of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> To renew your Covenant-Engagements unto God, under the renewed ſenſe, experience, power and efficacy of New-Covenant grace, by which you have had the experimental knowledge of Gods Covenant, in the ſaving Myſtery and Sufficiency of it, as a Covenant of Life, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with thoſe that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> and whereby God doth put his <hi>Covenant,</hi> write his <hi>Covenant</hi> in your hearts, <hi>Jer,</hi> 31.33— Thus renew your <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> by Faith, with an holy reſolution, to cleave unto God fully and firmly, to walk with God cloſely and conſtantly, in his holy <hi>Covenant,</hi> with fear and reverence, holily, humbly, chearfully, joyfully, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, faithfully, and fruitfully, in a way of Communion, with full and abundant ſatisfaction in your Intereſt in, and enjoyment of God as a God in Covenant; as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>For this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</hi> O Chriſtians, it is your work to uphold Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the life, ſpirit and power of it, and unto all the ſpiritual and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ends of it, as a Covenant of life, in theſe Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the duty of all thoſe who are not yet ſavingly in Covenant with God, actually, perſonally, and profeſſedly to take hold upon the Covenant.</hi> Gods Covenant, it muſt be thus renewed with his Church, in every Age of it, in order unto the continuation and ſucceſſion of it, from generation to generation. And thus to renew the <hi>Covenant,</hi> is the proper work of this Generation, of thoſe who are the Children of the Covenant, that is, to lay hold upon the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the onely Mediates of the Covenant; and in God through Jeſus Chriſt, as a God in Covenant with you: and ſo by giving up your ſelves into God, under the Bond of his Covenant, to walk with him, and to live unto him, in a way of Faith, and Goſpel-obedience, as his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant people. Thus to lay hold on Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and actually, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, and profeſſedly to Enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your being and ſtanding before God as his people, and indeed of your whole Religion. O how many be there of this Generation, growing, and grown up in theſe Churches, under the viſible diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> who do reſt, and truſt, and boaſt in their viſible <hi>Covenant relation,</hi> and all the while live without ſaving Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God? Yea, how do they profane, poliute, neglect, reject, contemn Gods holy Covenant, as profane <hi>Eſau</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. <hi>What
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64014:12"/>profit ſhall this Birthright do me?— Thus Eſau deſpiſed his Birthright.</hi> Know then, all you who are the Children of the Govenant, that it is by your taking hold upon the Covenant, that the Covenant is eſtabliſhed and confirmed unto you as your Covenant, and your Intereſt, in the Covenant aſſerted. For, whatever your viſible right and intereſt unto, and in the Covenant may be, and whatever your Confidences may be, yet if you do pollute, profane, neglect, reject, deſpiſe, contemn Gods Covenant, and not lay hold upon it, God will certainly take away his Covenant from you: Gods Covenant will certainly fail unto ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and <hi>then theſe Churches will fall to the ground.</hi> If you ſhould ſo reject Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and caſt off Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and caſt off you, as altogether unworthy of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and of the bleſſings of it, and ſay of you, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant into thy mouth?</hi> You ought highly to prize and eſteem your viſible right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt unto, and in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> hold it, aſſert it as an ineſtimable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: but O take heed of abuſing of it unto carnal Confidence, and of reſting in it; and take heed of ſlighting and neglecting of it. <hi>You are the Children of the Covenant;</hi> but yet <hi>think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have Abraham to our father,</hi> for God is able of the very ſtones to raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> And the Ax will be <hi>laid to the root of the tree, and every tree,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9, 10. You are <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome;</hi> but remember, that <hi>the Children of the Kingdome</hi> may be <hi>caſt out,</hi> and that will cauſe weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. It is by laying hold upon Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> that we do lay hold upon God himſelf. We may fear, (and that juſtly) that God will depart from us: and the great enquiry is. How we may keep God with us? Surely it lyes much, yea moſt, and almoſt onely in you, to retain the gracious Preſence of God in theſe Churches, by taking hold upon him by his <hi>Covenant.</hi> If you reject the Covenant, you reject God, and put him away from you: God will be gone, and teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. but <hi>my people would have none of me.</hi> And truly if God depart from, and reject you, there will be no place found for Repentance, though you may <hi>ſeek it carefully with tears,</hi> as <hi>Eſau</hi> did, when it was too late, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. If you ſhould go on generally and totally to neglect and reject Gods Covenant, God will at laſt <hi>break the ſtaves of Beauty and Bands,</hi> that is, break his Covenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it utterly from us, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.10.11. God hath not yet done it, he hath not yet diſowned us: but yet let me ſay, God hath not yet <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and ſignally</hi> owned us, by renewing and confirming his Covenant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64014:12"/>with us, in ſuch a way of ſpecial grace and favour, as he did with our Fathers, becauſe we have not ſo owned him, we are not yet ſo eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our ſtanding under the Covenant, as they were. <hi>It is yet doubtful what God will do with this poor Generation,</hi> onely God is yet waiting upon us, and proving and trying of us, to ſee whether we will take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Covenant, and upon himſelf by his Covenant, yea or no; and <hi>upon this Point will turn the weal or wo of this preſent, and of ſucceeding Generations.</hi> O that we underſtood how much we are concerned, thus to renew our Covenant with God!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Do the firſt works in all things pertaining to the Worſhip of God.</hi> After we have made us a new Heart, and renewed our Covenant, our next great work in a way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> it is to recover the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God from thoſe decayes which it is fallen into. The great work of Reformation in the Church of old, it was much, and moſt about the Worſhip of God, which is moſt properly Church-Reformation: and here our main work is, to recover our ſelves from that decay which we are fallen into, reſpecting the <hi>internal, ſpiritual power and purity of Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt labour to recover our firſt love to the Worſhip of God, both Moral and Inſtituted Worſhip:</hi> all duties of Worſhip, and all Wayes. Means, Ordinances of Worſhip. It was a very high eſteem of, and dear love unto, and delight in the Worſhip and Ordinances of God, whereby our Fathers were firſt allured, and moved to follow God into this Wilderneſs, O the firſt love of <hi>New-Englands</hi> firſt Eſpouſals, the kindneſs of her youth, when ſhe firſt followed God into this Land, meerly, and onely out of love unto, and delight in his Worſhip and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances! God remembers it, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. And truly, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it alſo, with ſhame and confuſion of face, under a ſenſe of our loſs of that love, and our (too much) ſlighting, neglecting and deſpiſing the Worſhip and Ordinances of God. O this is the original of all our decayes in the Worſhip of God: the heart of the Generation, the heart of <hi>New-England</hi> is much gone from the Worſhip and Ordinances of God; though we pretend and profeſs much zeal and love, yet our heart begins to be far removed from them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29 13. <hi>Foraſmuch as this people draw near to me with their mouth, and do honour me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me.</hi> Ezek. 33.31. <hi>For with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> O the heart of <hi>New-England</hi> is gone much from the Worſhip of God, after the World; yea truly, Chriſtians themſelves are much fallen in their love, eſteem, and delight of, and in the Worſhip of God. O
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64014:13"/>then let us labour to recover our firſt love, and to ſet our hearts to the Worſhip and Ordinances of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. <hi>Set your hearts unto all theſe things which I command you, for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life.</hi> Our very hearts and Souls muſt be ſet upon, and engaged unto the Worſhip of God, as a very dear and precious Intereſt, ſo as to prefer it above our chief joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.6. O the luke-warmneſs of the love of the generality of Worſhippers, to the Worſhip of God, is an evident ſign of our declenſion therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt labour to recover our firſt Zeal for the Houſe of God, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upholding, and maintaining the Worſhip and Ordinances of God.</hi> Cleave to them, and keep them up, by a lively, conſtant, ſtedfaſt, ſincere and holy Profeſſion; by an humble, profeſſed, practical ſubjection of your very Souls unto them; by a conſtant, diligent, religious, and profitable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention upon them, and improvement of them with intire love, peace and union, in a way of pure and holy Communion. Labour alſo to uphold the Worſhip and Ordinances of God, by <hi>teaching of them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to your Children,</hi> Deut. 6.7. Train up your Children in the Houſe of God, unto the Worſhip of God, that they may be prepared to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Worſhip and Ordinances of God in their places; in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It hath been heretofore the work of <hi>New-England,</hi> to build the Houſe of God, to ſet up the Worſhip and Ordinances of God: but now (alas!) it is (too much) our work, to pull down the Houſe, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Ordinances of God. Moſt of the ſins of the Times, and of the generation, have a ſtrong and direct tendenty thereunto. We are ſinning down, and ſinning away the Worſhip and Ordinances of God; eſpecially by our Pride, Wantonneſs, cannot Confidence in our viſible Liberties and Priviledges carnal eaſe and reſt, Carnality, Formality, Hypocriſie, Spiritual Idolatry in the Worſhip of God, our manifold both groſs and more ſpiritual Profanations and Pollutions of the Houſe, Worſhip and Ordinances of God. O theſe evils growing, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt us, and many of the moſt notorious and ſcandalous ſins of the Times getting into Churches, and corrupting of Churches, do ſadly ſignifie, at leaſt great danger of the downfall of the Houſe, Worſhip, and Ordinances of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10, 12. But that which is yet moſt ſadly ſignal, it is, that there is not likely to be a people fit to uphold ſuch pure Churches. Worſhip and Ordinances, (at leaſt) not in the internal, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power and purity of them. If we do conſider how much both Civil and Religious Education is neglected; and if we look upon the ſad face of the Riſing generation, and ſee how much of Ignorance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, Profaneneſs, Diſobedience, Rebellion and Irreligion doth already
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64014:13"/>appear in the Conntenance of it; what an ungracious, irreligious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there is likely to ariſe among us, unleſs God in infinite mercy work a great and wonderful change, our hearts may well <hi>tremble</hi> to think <hi>what will become of the Worſhip and Ordinances of God in the next Age.</hi> Many there are hopeful; but alas! how few, in compariſon with the Numbers of this numerous generation. Here is a <hi>ſecond</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ariſen, and a <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> generation ariſing apace, and truly we have cauſe to fear, that every generation will be leſs hopefull then other, untill at laſt, that wofull Saying be verified of us, which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.10. <hi>And there aroſe another generation after them, which knew not the Lord.</hi> O unleſs God work graciouſly to ſave theſe degenerating generations, there will be ſmall hope of the long continuance of the pure Worſhip and Ordinances of God here: the Worſhip of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will either revive and live, or elſe utterly decay and die, with the Riſing Generations. Unto this we may further adde, the <hi>graduall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves of the Glory,</hi> the diſappearances of the Divine Preſence, the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God from his own Houſe; a ſad ſign that <hi>our Houſe</hi> will be e're long <hi>left unto us deſolate.</hi> O how much then are we concerned to labour (as much as in us lyeth) by all means to uphold and maintain the Worſhip and Ordinances of God in their ſpiritual power and purity, leaſt <hi>the Glory</hi> ſhould <hi>depart from</hi> this <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Light of the Goſpel be again utterly extinguiſhed in this Weſtern World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt uphold and maintain our firſt love unto, and zeal for the external purity</hi> (which through the grace of God is yet continued unto us) <hi>in the Worſhip of God.</hi> The voice of Chriſt unto theſe <hi>New-England Churches,</hi> is as unto the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Rev. 2.25. <hi>That which thou haſt already, hold faſt untill I come.</hi> Keep and preſerve pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, purity in the Worſhip of God: preſerve the <hi>primitive purity</hi> of theſe Churches, according to their Reformed Conſtitution by <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> that is, <hi>pure inſtituted Churches:</hi> purity in the Conſtitution of Churches, is the ground-work of pure Worſhip. Preſerve a <hi>pure Miniſtry,</hi> conſtituted exactly according to Goſpel-order, reſpecting all the Offices of it, the Power, the Inveſtiture, the Exerciſe, the whole Work and Service of it; ſuch a Miniſtry as our Lord Jeſus hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed, Chriſts Miniſtry. Preſerve theſe pure Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinances, the Ordinances of Chriſt: <hi>Admit of nothing as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Worſhip, but that which Chriſt hath inſtituted and ordained;</hi> and keep the pure Ordinances of Chriſt, in the <hi>purity</hi> of them, in the Goſpel <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of them, without any corrupt Mixtures in, or with any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt, which is ordinarily the firſt inlet of corrupt Worſhip
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64014:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>into moſt Reformed Churches. O let us keep and cleave unto naked Ordinances, ſimple Ordinances; the Cryſtalline purity of the waters of the Sanctuary, which are, as they ariſe and flow from the Fountain of Divine Inſtitution, clear as Cryſtal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. Preſerve purity of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, reſpecting both the Power, Subject, and Order of Adminiſtration. Preſerve pure and holy Order in the Adminiſtration of every Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. This holy Order is the Beauty of Churches, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. Diſorder, it is a general Corruption in Worſhip; it corrupteth both Churches, Ordinances, and Adminiſtrations, and ſo it makes <hi>the Houſe of God</hi> like <hi>a Den of Thieves, Mat.</hi> 20.13— O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, this purity of Worſhip, it hath been the Eminency and Excellency of theſe Churches, not yet loſt as to the external Form of it. It was Gods deſign and work, not only to ſet up his Worſhip in <hi>New-England,</hi> but to ſet it up in the purity of it, by a <hi>purging, refining Reformation.</hi> God did therefore qualifie his Reformers with extraordinary Humility, Sincerity, and holy Zeal for purity of Worſhip; and made extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſcoveries of his Minde and Will, concerning his Worſhip unto them: He did ſhew them the <hi>Pattern,</hi> the Platform (as I may say) of his Houſe, that they might ſhew it unto us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11. O how much then are we engaged to preſerve purity of Worſhip? Purity, it is the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Worſhip, it is the Beauty and glory of Churches, it is that which maketh Churches ſhine, as <hi>golden Candleſticks;</hi> it makes Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> Pſal. 29.2. &amp; 110.3. It makes the Church to appear in her Spiritual Beauty, in her ornaments, as a Spiritual Bride adorned and trimmed for her heavenly Bridegroom. That purity of Worſhip, which ſhall be after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, will be the chief perfection, if not the conſummation of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2.3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.11. Then let us be moved to prize and preſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Worſhip. And to this end, we muſt ſubject our ſelves, our very Souls, freely, fully, &amp; moſt ſincerely, unto the Power, Authority, Rule and Government of Chriſt, as it is Regularly, Miniſterially exerciſed and adminiſtred in his Church, in the Adminiſtration of all his O dinances. Exalt Chriſt in the Exerciſe of his Kingly office in his Church: whilſt Chriſt is walking amidſt the Churches, holding the Stars in his right hand, they will remain golden Candleſticks. If we do debaſe Chriſt, and ſet up our own wiſdomes and wills, in and about the Worſhip of God, then farewell to purity of Worſhip. Again, if we will preſerve purity of Worſhip, we muſt keep up internal, ſpiritual purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, in the Worſhip of God: we muſt be holy, pure, ſpiritual Worſhippers; we muſt keep up the Worſhip of God in the internal,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64014:14"/>ſpiritual power and purity of it in our hearts; theſe pure Churches, Worſhip, and Ordinances, will not, cannot ſtand, without internal, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power and purity. If we do corrupt the Worſhip and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God by our Carnality, Formality, Hypocriſie, and Spiritual Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſuch like ſpiritual corruptions, and heart-abominations, in the exerciſe of it, God will take it from us. It is our Spiritual and Heart-Apoſtacy, from internal, ſpiritual power and purity of Worſhip, that is the deep and moſt dangerous defection of theſe Churches in Worſhip. And although we do yet retain purity of Worſhip in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Form of it, yet if we do not ſpeedily recover that which we have loſt, of the internal, ſpiritual power and purity of Worſhip, but perſiſt in our ſpiritual Apoſtacy from it, whatever our pretended, profeſſed zeal for viſible and external purity of Worſhip may be, we ſhall let go, &amp; loſe all, pull down all, and bury our ſelves in our own ruines: <hi>New-England</hi> will be no more unto God, then any other people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab— for all theſe Nations are uncircumciſed, and all the houſe of Iſrael are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We muſt labour to recover our firſt holy Care and Watchfulneſs againſt all Will-worſhip, corrupt Worſhip, and Corruptions in Worſhip.</hi> Surely, it hath been heretofore, and almoſt hereunto, the Commendation of theſe Churches, that they have been ſincerely, fervently, ſtedfaſtly zealous againſt all kindes and degrees of Will-worſhip. It was the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in her declining ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 6— <hi>how thou canſt not bear them that are evil—Yet this thou haſt</hi>— God grant that theſe Churches may never loſe this part of their Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that our Lord Jeſus may never have occaſion againſt us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us, and threaten us for our careleſneſs, negligence, <hi>ſinful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance and Indulgence</hi> in this point, as he did the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Rev.</hi> 2.14. and of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> ver. 20. — <hi>becauſe thou ſuffereſt</hi>— It may be we are too ſecure, and not aware of any danger of corrupt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: let me ſay, The more need we have of this warning; for Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip doth ordinarily creep into Reformed Churches whilſt they are aſleep, gradually, ſecretly, and inſenſibly, and grow up unto a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and formidable height and ſtrength, before it appears, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Churches are aware: thus the Church of <hi>Laod cea</hi> deeply corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corrup. Worſhip, and <hi>knew it not,</hi> Rev. 3.7. O theſe Churches in this declining, ſcure, lukewarm frame, are in great danger of it; let us therefore remember and receive the Apoſtles Exhortation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64014:15"/>free, and be not again intangled with the yoke of bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us take heed and beware of all diſpoſitions and inclinations unto Will-worſhip.</hi> Watch againſt the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of it: Corrupt Worſhip gets in firſt by the <hi>ſpirit and principles</hi> of it, and by the ſpiritual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in the heart of a people. It gets firſt into the heart; a people may uphold the pure Worſhip of God in the viſible and external Form of it, with much ſeeming love and zeal, and yet their heart deeply cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Will-worſhip. When the heart of a people is gone from God and his Worſhip, it argues their heart is corrupted with a ſpirit of Will-worſhip, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13— there is a whoriſh heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 69. <hi>They have broken me with their whoriſh heart;</hi> there is a <hi>ſpirit of Whoredome,</hi> Hoſ. 4.12. How far the heart of <hi>New-England</hi> is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with this ſpirit of Will-worſhip, with prae-diſpoſitions and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations thereunto, would (we may fear) too ſoon and ſadly appear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a temptation thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us watch againſt all the wayes and workings of it,</hi> even the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſubtile, inſenſible infinuations and intruſions of it; againſt all the depths and devices of Satan, working by the darkeſt and deepeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Hell, to introduce Will-worſhip into Reformed Churches. We may think our ſelves ſecure from it, unleſs over-born by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering violence of ſome external Temptation: but believe it, Satan hath divers and various Forms of Will-worſhip, ſuited and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the divers conſtitutions &amp; conditions of Churches, and the diverſe ſpirit and diſpoſition of people that he hath to deal withall; he hath <hi>many Antichriſts,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.17. there is a divers working of the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3. This ſpirit worketh by the <hi>power of Satan, in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.7. And truly, we have had many Antichriſts. It hath been alwayes Satans deſign, to introduce corrupt Worſhip into theſe Churches, under the moſt ſpecious and ſpiritual Forms of it, by a direct contrary Extreme unto groſs Ceremony and Superſtition; the more cauſe we have to be very watchful, againſt all ſuch wayes and workings of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us watch againſt all Temptations unto corrupt Worſhip,</hi> whether more ſecret, or more open. There are many Temptations thereunto: there is the Temptation of falſe Teachers, corrupting the Doctrine of Worſhip, and teaching of Will-worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the Commandments of men:</hi> Rev. 2.20. —<hi>to teach, and to ſeduce</hi>— There is the Temptation of corrupt <hi>Communion,</hi> tempting Communion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Let no man beguile you,</hi> &amp;c. There is the Temptation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and Diſſention, tending to drive dividing Parties into Extremes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64014:15"/>in thoſe matters of Worſhip which they contend about, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4, 17. The Intereſt of a Party, it is a very great and ſtrong Temptation: a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Diviſion, (eſpecially) when acting and working with a blinde, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, prepoſterous, ſuperſtitious Zeal in matters of Worſhip, and when it is become <hi>judicial and incurable,</hi> never fails to bring in corrupt Worſhip at one door or another. It is the deſign of Satan, to bring in Will-worſhip in the ſmoke and ſmother of the fire of Contentions; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions do alwayes corrupt Churches. There is alſo the Temptation of an undue <hi>Toleration,</hi> which doth open a way to all the former, and lead into corrupt Compliances in wayes of corrupt Worſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.20. There is alſo the Temptation of Perſecution, and Tribulation—O there are many Temptations unto corrupt Worſhip, and theſe Churches have not been without ſome of theſe Temptations thereunto; ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are likely to multiply upon us. O what cauſe have we then to be zealouſly and wakefully watchful, more eſpecially againſt ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are inſtant, and moſt urgent and prevalent, and of which we do already begin to ſee and feel the ſad and lamentable effects: and that confidering there is ſuch a prae-diſpoſition in the very Spirit and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Generation, to enter into this Temptation, and ſuch a powerful working of a Spirit of <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> to make way for, and lead into this Temptation; and alſo that men of corrupt Spirits, Principles and Practiſes, ſcandalous, corrupters, and broachers of corrupt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, open and profeſſed Enemies unto pure Churches, Worſhip and Ordinances, are ariſen unto ſo high a degree of bold Preſumption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; and that notwithſtanding, they know that Publick Authority is by good and wholſome Laws, and ſo by Oath, and ſo by Conſcience, and by divers obligations, both Civil and Sacred, engaged againſt them. I am no Caſuiſt, in the great Caſe of <hi>Toleration,</hi> neither ſhall I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take either to ſtate, diſpute, or decide that Queſtion; what is in it ſelf, or in divers reſpects or caſes, at divers times and places, either Tolerable or Intolerable, in matters diſputable: But this I take to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, That groſs, bold, ſcandalous, preſumptuous tranſgreſſion of any one, or more, or all the Commandments of the <hi>Firſt Table,</hi> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and perſiſted in with an high hand, notwithſtanding <hi>all due means of Conviction</hi> uſed, and againſt clear light held forth, and manifeſtly under the Prevailing Power of a Spirit of Errour, with malignity, in open oppoſition to the Truth, the true Churches, worſhip and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt; I ſay, I take it to be unqueſtionable, That ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion it is <hi>Intolerable.</hi> Such I take to be the tranſgreſſion of thoſe <hi>who do groſly and ſcandalouſly profane any of the holy Ordinances of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64014:16"/>Chriſt, in the Adminiſtration of them,</hi> preſuming to offer <hi>ſtrange fire:</hi> but much more of thoſe who do <hi>both profeſſedly and practically deny moſt, if not all Fundamentals, both of Faith and Order, and are known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo to do by all the Reformed Churches</hi> in the world; who are in their wayes of corrupt worſhip no leſs <hi>the Synagogue of Satan,</hi> then thoſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. Now I ſay, if ſuch Tranſgreſſors and Tranſgreſſions ſhould (after the long <hi>labour and patience</hi> of theſe Churches, in a ſtrong and ſtedfaſt encounter and conflict with this Temptation) at laſt prevail to break open a door unto corrupt worſhip, by <hi>Teaching, Seducing, Tempting</hi> and <hi>Enticing</hi> others unto corrupt Communion with them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>the Doctrine of Balaam, to caſt a ſtumbling block before the people of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14. I ſay, if this ſhould come to paſs, our caſe would be exceeding dangerous; eſpecially this coming upon us in our declining and languiſhing ſtate, when we have loſt ſo much of our <hi>firſt life and love,</hi> that we have ſoarcely ſtrength enough left, to reinforce our former <hi>Zeal and Courage</hi> in the Encounter, yea, and at ſuch a time when the Generation is lamentably expoſed, by the ſins of the Times, (which are all tempting unto a Compliance with ſuch a Temptation) and are (too much) without grace to reſiſt it; and in a very unſetled ſtate, as to their ſtanding before God under his Covenant, even ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dangerous Precipice of a groſs Apoſtacy, the very opportunity for Satan to over throw us by ſuch a Temptation. Surely, if it be thus, or likely to be thus, then there is very great need of watchſulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Temptation. Neither let it be ſlighted, or accounted a light thing: for, ſuch Profanations and Abominations, if <hi>Indulged,</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſins of the Land, and the guilt and Puniſhment of them will lye, and fall exceeding heavy upon the Land in a day of wrath: O they will pull down wrath upon this Land, and upon this People; and the filth of them will pollute and defile the Land: it will be ſuch Pollution as will not be purged away without fire, the guilt and filth of corrupt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is not purged away without the fire and the fornace. And that which is moſt Perillous, it is the univerſal diffuſion of the Corruption and Contagion of corrupt worſhip, by the ſubtile and inſenſible infuſion and influence of a Spirit of <hi>Libertiniſm:</hi> a <hi>Spirit and Principle</hi> (it is) of all other, moſt dangerous and deſtructive unto Pure Churches, and will ſoon open a wide door unto all kinde of Abominations: for all falſe worſhips, (although they ſeem, in themſelves, to be contrary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes) yet they all agree in this Principle of <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> and will break in at that door. It will be in vain for us to hope for, or Promiſe our ſelves Security from groſs Superſtition and Ceremony, if we will leave
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64014:16"/>open this door, or admit of a contrary Extreme in corrupt worſhip. And truly, if we ſhould give way unto any kinde, it will be juſt with God, to give us up Judicially unto all kindes of corrupt worſhip. And let me adde, That a <hi>Spirit of Libertiniſm,</hi> if it prevail, will in the end bring in all kinde of Licentiouſneſs and Profaneneſs; for it is a Womb, big with all kinde of Abominations; for, corruption in Worſhip, and conruption in Manners, do alwayes grow and go together. See at large <hi>Ezck.</hi> 22. <hi>beginning.</hi> Although Libertiniſm doth promiſe much Liberty, yet it bringeth <hi>into bondage to Corruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. It doth <hi>gender</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unto bondage. O that theſe Churches may recover their <hi>firſt Zeal againſt Libertiniſm,</hi> both the Spirit, Principle, and Practiſe of it! and ſo againſt all corrupt worſhip, which hath been the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Reformed Churches, and will moſt certainly be of theſe Churches, if it ſhould break in upon us. O let us conſider, we have been hither unto a People extraordinarily Priviledged, with Immunity from corrupt worſhip; we are yet free from any foraign or forcible Temptation thereunto; we have yet all Advantages and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to withſtand it, and to keep it out. If we admit of will-worſhip, we ſhall loſe all the glorious work of Reformation which our Fathers laboured in, (which conſiſted chiefly <hi>in Separation from corrupt Worſhip</hi>) we ſhall at once reze the Foundation, and ruine the Superſtructure of theſe Churches, which in the very Conſtitution were ſet up, and ſtand in a way of oppoſition unto corrupt worſhip: ſuch Churches will not, cannot bear any degree of corrupt worſhip. VVill-worſhip, it would even deſtroy our very Religion, and reduce this VVilderneſs-People unto a kinde of Heatheniſm. O wo unto us, if we admit of will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we ſhall ſoon fill up the meaſure of our ſin, and prepare our ſelves for Judgement, <hi>even wrath to the utmoſt.</hi> O wo unto <hi>New-England,</hi> if ever God be provoked to revenge this quarrel of his Covenant upon us, according to that Threatning, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.25. If we admit of will-worſhip, <hi>New-England</hi> will become the ſhame and ſcandal of Religion, and of all Reformed Churches, the Reproach of the Chriſtian world, the Scorn and Triumph of Antichriſt, and in all reſpects a moſt ſinful and miſerable People. Thus we are to <hi>do our firſt works,</hi> in all things pertaining to the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Labour unto the promotion and progreſs of the work of Reformation, by the full and faithful diſcharge of duty to the Children of the Covenant,</hi> multiplying and growing up under the Covenant in thoſe Churches; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how great and general omiſſion of duty towards them, we have cauſe ſeriouſly and ſadly to conſider, and to lament. Truly, it is much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64014:17"/>to be feared, that we ſhall ſo long doubt and diſpute the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of fuch Children, and controvert, and neglect our duty towards them, untill the holy Seed will be wholly corrupted, and the Purity, if not the Conſtitution of theſe Churches be greatly endangered, if not loſt. It is ſad to conſider, how much many Churches are already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by the Licentiouſneſs and Profaneneſs of many, if not moſt of the Children of the Covenant. Many, if not moſt, of the ſins of Youth (which are many of them ſome of the moſt flagitious ſins of the Times) are become the ſins of Churches, and the guilt of them doth lye heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Churches, with this heavy aggravation, that they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the neglect of duty towards them, by the due exerciſe of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> If yet there be <hi>any hope in Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> (as it is ſpoken of a very difficult Point of <hi>Reformation</hi>) <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2. I ſay, if there be any hope of Reformation in this matter, it muſt be by a holy, religious, ſaving Education of the Children of the Covenant, and that both in Private and in Publick, Doubtleſs there is an extraordinary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon Covenant-Parents, to train up their Children for God; and a great motive it is unto all care, labour and diligence, unto ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Family-Education, for ſuch Parents to conſider, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Children of the Covenant, and in this fenſe <hi>Gods Children,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. and the <hi>Children of the Promiſe,</hi> Acts 2.39, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpecial Promiſe of ſaving grace and bleſſing: on the one hand, it is a very ſad and lamentable conſideration, unto any Religiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Labour to imitate faithful <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. But that which I chiefly intend, in this Particular, is <hi>Publick Eaucation,</hi> (if I may ſo call it) Surely Churches do owe much duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Children of the Covenant, commonly ſtyled, <hi>The Children of the Church:</hi> they are doubtleſs the Subject of the eſpecial care and induſtry of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> to be watched over, warned, inſtructed, admoniſhed, both Privately and Publickly. <hi>Churches</hi> alſo are to own them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, viſibly, as they do gradually grow up unto maturity and capacity unto Church-watch and Priviledges. If they be in any wiſe under the Covenant, and ſo of <hi>the viſible Kingdome of Chriſt;</hi> they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64014:17"/>muſt needs be under his Rule and Government, which is no way right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred, but by the regular exerciſe of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in Inſtituted Churches. O they have been very unhappy Controverſies to theſe Churches, whereby the vigorous exerciſe of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> unto theſe, hath been ſo long demurred and delayed, that very many of them are grown up unto ſuch an height and ſtrength in Profaneneſs, that they have even broken, and caſt off the Yoke of Chriſts Government in his Church, and are grown incorrigible, and incurable by <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> And truly, this neglect is grown ſo great and general (at leaſt) in ſome Churches, that there is very little hope of the recovery of the vigorous, effectual exerciſe of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> toward them. So that the current of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Generation, is likely to break in like a flood upon the Churches at this breach, and in ſhort time to carry all before it. <hi>It is one of the moſt fatal ſigns which is upon theſe Churches,</hi> that this one evil is likely to prove both ruining and remedileſs; and is the more ſadly ſignal, becauſe we are no more ſenſible of it, and no more concerned by our Prayers and Endeavours to Reform it. Let me ſay, The Progreſs of the Covenant, the Propagation of Churches, the Preſervation of Churches under their deepeſt defection, in their loweſt condition, it muſt be by the ſucceſſion of an holy Seed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.13. <hi>So the holy Seed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof.</hi> If we <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchurch</hi> them, either Doctrinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Practically, by the general and total neglect of them, and our duty toward them, we do thereby lay the foundation of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> both of theſe Churches, and of the whole Generation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Labour unto the promotion and progreſs of the work of Reformation, by a full, faithful, and religious improvement of your Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> There is a Spirit and Principle of Liberty in the hearts of all ſincere Chriſtians, whom Chriſt hath <hi>made free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8.36. <hi>Where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. There is a very large and neceſſary uſe and exerciſe of this Spirit and Principle of Liberty, in our whole Chriſtian Converſation, eſpecially in all our religious converſe with God and men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>For Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty.</hi> Our Chriſtian Liberty is regulated moſt exactly and ſtrictly, by Rules and Precepts in the Word of God: there is a compleat directory for the exerciſe of our Chriſtian Liberty in the Word of God, which is the <hi>perfect law of liberty,</hi> Jam. 1.25. Our habitual conformity to this Law of Liberty, is the chief Principle of Liberty; and our Practical Subjection to the Law of Liberty, is the chief Practiſe or Exerciſe of our Liberty. This Liberty is alwayes acted under the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Divine Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth, and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64014:18"/>truth ſhall make you free.</hi> Jam. 2.12. <hi>So ſpeak, and ſo do— judged by the law of liberty.</hi> This Chriſtian Liberty doth not give men leave to believe, Profeſs and Practiſe what they will, (as <hi>Libertines</hi> do vainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) and from thence plead for a <hi>Licentious Liberty</hi> of Conſcience, and a <hi>boundleſs Latitude</hi> both of Profeſſion and Practiſe in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. True Chriſtian Liberty holdeth Conſcience faſt bound to the Rule: there are <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Immunities,</hi> commonly called Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in and about which our Chriſtian Liberty is to be exerciſed, as the proper Subject of this Liberty. Thoſe we muſt hold, keep, and ſtand fuſt in, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free.</hi> And we muſt be careful to exerciſe our Chriſtian Liberty in a way of Goſpel-order; Liberty and Order are inſeparable, in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Chriſtian: it is the Liberty of <hi>Order,</hi> our Liberty is laid out, and limitted by <hi>Order;</hi> thoſe therefore that do plead for Liberty, unto the ſubverſion of <hi>Order,</hi> are Libertines, and dangerous Enemies unto Liberty. We muſt alſo exerciſe and improve our Chriſtian Liberty in a way of full ſubjection unto the Power, Rule and Government of Chriſt Miniſterially exerciſed in his Church, in the Adminiſtration of all his ordinances, as the free Subjects of his Spiritual Kingdome. Thoſe who riſe up in a way of oppoſition unto, or rebellion againſt the Power of Chriſt, regularly exerciſed in his Church, under pretence of the defence of their Liberty, are no true friends to true Liberty. VVe muſt alſo improve and exerciſe our Liberty in way of Love, Peace, Union, and Communion, unto mutual edification and comfort: <hi>By love ſerving one another,</hi> Gal. 5.3. O this is the onely ſweet and comfortable life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty. It is a very ſinful, ſhameful abuſe of Chriſtian Liberty, to make it an <hi>occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> to make it ſubſervient to Libertiniſm, to Licentiouſneſs, to carnal Reaſon and Policy, to worldly Deſigns and Ends, to the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of men, in fomenting Diviſions &amp; Contentions, and of making it <hi>a cloak of maliciouſneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.16 — Surely it is a great part of our work of Reformation, to Reform theſe Abuſes of our Chriſtian Liberty. VVe are People highly Priviledged with Chriſtian Liberty, and advantaged to the exerciſe of it, O that we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood it, and improved it! Let us alwayes remember to keep our Liberty wholly ſubſervient unto our Religion, and not ſet up Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty above Religion; if ſo, we ſhall loſe both our Religion and our Liberty together.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Labour unto the promotion and progreſs of the work of Reformation, by recovery of your firſt Love, Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> O the loſs of our firſt Love, Peace and Union, hath hitherto been an irreparable loſs, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64014:18"/>wound, concerning which we may take up our Lamentation, and ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22. <hi>The harveſt is paſt, the ſummer is ended, and we are not healed: for the hurt of my people, I am hurt, I am black: aſtoniſhment hath taken hold upon me. Is there no Balm in Gilead? is there no Phyſician there? why then is not the hurt of the daughter of my people recovered?</hi> O are our Diviſions become judicial, and ſo incurable? If ſo, our ſtate is truly lamentable, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Enter not into the houſe of mourning, neither go to lament, nor bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, ſaith the Lord, even loving kindneſs and mercies.</hi> If it ſhould be ſo, well might the hearts and hopes of all our faithful Leaders fail, whoſe labours have hither unto much failed. Surely then the recovery of our firſt Love, Peace and Union, is a chief part of the work of Reformation, and will be found a very hard and difficult part of the work. In order hereunto,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt remember from whence we are fallen.</hi> O let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſweetneſs and bleſſedneſs of our firſt Love, Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, convince and humble us under the ſin of our Envyings, Strifes, Debates, Diviſions, Contentions and Emulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was the ſad ſtate of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that although they were lamentably diſtreſſed and diſtracted with Diviſions, yet they were not ſenſible of the ſin of them, but were <hi>puffed up, and did glory</hi> one againſt another. O that it were nothing ſo with us! truly, ſo long as it is ſo, there will be no hope of healing. O that we were convinced of the ſin of our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the multitude of ſins that are begotten by it, that we might mourn penitentially, and bemoan our ſelves before God with broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and earneſtly beſeech him to pardon, and to purge away all that ſin, and to grant us reforming grace. Truly, untill we are thus convinced and humbled, there will be no Reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt labour to recover <hi>our firſt Spirit</hi> of Love, Peace and Union; <hi>pray earneſtly unto God, to pour his Spirit upon us, a Spirit of Love,</hi> to pour out abundance of the grace of Love; to <hi>create</hi> Love, Peace and Union for us; and to take away the Spirit of Diviſion, which we are ſo deeply corrupted withall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt labour to recover our firſt New-England Intereſt;</hi> that is, that Intereſt upon which this People, and theſe Churches were firſt founded, as to their Religious Conſtitution, which is <hi>God and Religion:</hi> this is the onely uniting Intereſt, our very hearts and Souls will cleave and unite moſt intirely, in Love, with Peace and Union, in our God and our Religion; this Intereſt will make a people of <hi>one heart,</hi> and of <hi>one Soul,</hi> Jer. 32.39. — <hi>They ſhall be my people, and I will be their God, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64014:19"/>I will give them one heart and one way, to fear me.</hi> Obſerve, when a people do cleave cloſe to God and his Covenant, and ſo unto Religion, they have <hi>one heart and one way,</hi> that is, ſweet and perfect Unity and Amity. O this is our great miſchief and miſery, and the very original of our defection, that we have much forſaken our proper <hi>New-England Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;</hi> we have committed theſe two great evils, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Forſaken our God, and hewn out Ciſterns:</hi> We have been changing of our main Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Intereſt; we have been deſerting our own <hi>Religious Intereſt,</hi> &amp; eſpouſing another, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a <hi>Worldly Intereſt;</hi> we are turning from God, after the World; the World is becoming the main Intereſt of <hi>N. E.</hi> and we are becoming a worldly people, a people of a worldly Spirit, Principles &amp; Practiſes. I do not mean onely, nor ſo much, in ſeeking and proſecuting the things of the World, (although that be enough to denominate us notoriouſly Worldly) but our turning our very Religion it ſelf into a Worldly Intereſt, by making of it the ſubject of Carnal Confidences, reſting, truſting, and boaſting in it, and alſo by making of it the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Carnal Contentions, and ſo ſetting Religion againſt it ſelf, and the Profeſſors of it one againſt another, and ſo making of it ſubſervient unto worldly deſigns, yea unto worldly luſts, and thereby making it, in our Profeſſion and Practiſe of it, a meer Worldly Religion; yea, too many do too much make their profeſſed Confidence in God himſelf, a worldly Intereſt &amp; ſubſervient to their worldly luſts, as they <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. —<hi>Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord in the midſt of us? none evil can come unto us.</hi> When a worldly Spirit, worldly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, worldly Wiſdome and Counſels, do ſway and preponderate in all matters, both Civil and Religious, then a people are fully and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled upon a Worldly Intereſt, and are truly become a Worldly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And then comes all kinde of Diſſentions, Contentions, Emulations, Strifes, Debate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the World is alwayes a dividing Intereſt, and all our Diviſions are carnal and worldly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3 — Whatever pretences of a Religious Zeal, the Fomentors of Diviſion may make, it is a Worldly Spirit that foments all Diviſions; and it is utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ever a worldly ſpirited people ſhould unite upon ſure grounds of Union, or that any people ſhould ever unite at all in a worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. And therefore if we can relinquiſh our worldly Intereſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive our own onely true and proper Intereſt, which is <hi>our God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> ſet and ſettle our hearts again upon <hi>God and Religion,</hi> this would heal all our Diviſions, and reform all. As <hi>a change of Intereſt</hi> hath been the great Cauſe of our general defection; ſo <hi>a change of Intereſt</hi> again, would conſummate our <hi>Reformation.</hi> It is the Preſcription which God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64014:19"/>gives unto that Backſliding people for their recovery, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2.3. <hi>Take with you words, and turn to the Lord, and ſay unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Asſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall take leave (now in the Coneluſion) to propoſe this general Exhortation unto Reformation, more particularly, unto thoſe who are eſpecially concerned as Reformers.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I crave leave to Apply my ſelf (yet with humility and ſincerity (as it becometh me, ſpeaking in the Name and fear of God) unto Thoſe, who are, or who ſhall be Eſtabliſhed, or Re-eſtabliſhed (this day) in Place of Rule and Government among us, as our <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> Much Honoured, that which I have humbly to offer unto You in the Name of the Lord, and on the behalf of this People, it is this plain (yet great word) of Exhortation: Whereby I do moſt humbly beſeech you, to labour in your Place, by the utmoſt and moſt faithful improvement of your Power, Intereſt, Wiſdome, Grace, and Spirit of Government which you have received from the Lord, to promote this great Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in all the Parts, and in all the Degrees of it. This Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo this Magiſtracy, it was through the moſt wife and merciful Providence of God, conſtituted unto a more direct ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency unto the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as the great and main deſign of it, in the intentions both of God, and of all his faithful People. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God Spirited our <hi>firſt Magiſtracy</hi> unto this Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and proſpered that glorious Work unto a very happy progreſs, under their Civil Conduct of this Religious and Reforming people. And now the Place, the Power, the whole Betruſtment of this <hi>Reforming Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,</hi> it is by our Annual <hi>Election,</hi> and ſo by a Providential Succeſſion, devolving upon You, and remaineth veſted in You. Therefore our eyes, our hearts, our hopes, are (under God, and as to men) much upon You as our Reformers. It is our great hope, and will be our great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, to <hi>ſee the Plummet ſtin in the hand of Zerubbabel, with thoſe Seven;</hi> to ſee a powerful and proſperous progreſs of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, under your hand, labouring therein with a full concurrence of Divine Aſſiſtance. True it is, there are great Mountains ſtanding before you; but this is the Word of the Lord unto you, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit:</hi> if the Lord Spirit you unto the Work, they ſhall become a Plain; and although the work be much declined, it ſhall be again revived, and the <hi>Topſtone</hi> thereof ſhall be brought forth with <hi>Shoutings</hi> and Acclamations of Grace, unto the glory of God. It
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64014:20"/>hath been a great (if not the greateſt) Honour, which God hath pu upon Civil Magiſtracy, and that which addeth true Glory unto its Greatneſs, That he hath made Civil Magiſtrates, <hi>Reformers.</hi> Seldome hath there been any great Work of Reformation wrought, either in the Church of old, or in the ſucceeding Ages of it, but God hath made Kings, Princes, and Civil Magiſtrates, his Miniſters in it. And alwayes, in the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of the Kingdome of Chriſt, he hath cauſed <hi>the Mountains to bring peace, and the little hills righteouſneſs.</hi> The Church on earth will be in the height and top of its proſperity, when <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords Houſe ſhall be exalted in the tops of the Mountains; when Kings ſhall be her Nurſing-fathers, and Queens her Nurſing-mothers.</hi> You have the moſt encouraging Examples of the moſt Illuſtrious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for mers before you: You know this people, their preſent ſpirit, ſtate and way; You have been with us at <hi>Maſſah,</hi> at <hi>Meribah,</hi> and at <hi>Kibroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hattaavah,</hi> where we have both tempted God, and tryed you. You may well ſay of us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did of them, <hi>I know thy rebellion, and thy ſtiff neck;</hi> and ſo you may by a ſolemn Conteſtation, call Heaven and Earth to record againſt us, as he did ſometime againſt them. You are to labour with a very immorigerous, rebellious, backſliding generation, under an extraordinary juncture of Provocations and Temptations, Difficulties and Dangers. O ſo much the more I am imboldened in the Name of the Lord, with an humble importunity, to beſeech your Care, Conſtancy, Courage and Faithfulneſs in this your great Duty, leſt the <hi>Ruine</hi> of this Self-deſtroying people, ſhould be found <hi>under your hand.</hi> It will be your Glory, not onely to be Reformers, but <hi>Repairers</hi> and <hi>Reſtorers,</hi> to <hi>Repair the Breach, and to raiſe up Foundations for many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi> Such as You, are in Scripture called not onely <hi>Gods,</hi> but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours;</hi> and <hi>Saviours, raiſed up upon Mount Sion:</hi> we ſtyle you ſo with Modeſty and Sobriety, in Scripture phraſe and ſenſe, as ſtill remembring that <hi>you muſt die like men.</hi> But hereby we underſtand that you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in &amp; betruſted with ſomewhat that is Sacred; you cannot approve your ſelves to be <hi>Gods</hi> more, then by the Patronage of Religion; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve your ſelves to be <hi>Saviours</hi> more, then by being Reformers, <hi>Reformation</hi> will be our <hi>Salvation.</hi> We are to chuſe you this day for God; and ſo doing, we may hope that God will in mercy chuſe you for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You being ſo Choſen, both by God, and his people, are under a double, and ſo indiſpenſible Obligation, even by your <hi>Election,</hi> to be for God, and for his people; that is, for the promotion and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is the main Intereſt of God and his people here, which is <hi>Religion.</hi> You are to Rule not onely over <hi>Men,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64014:20"/>onely over <hi>People,</hi> but the <hi>People of God:</hi> therefore you are to Rule, as in <hi>the fear of God,</hi> ſo in a more peculiar manner from God, and for God, that God may Rule by you, that you may be <hi>the Miniſters of God for our good.</hi> God hath ſet you as our <hi>Hedge,</hi> and as our <hi>Wall,</hi> whereby he hath encloſed this his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and all his precious and pleaſant things with us; he hath ſet you as a part of <hi>the Defence upon the Glory,</hi> God doth therefore expect, that you ſhould fully Aſſert and Exert all that Power which he hath committed to you, to be improved for the publick Weal of his people, eſpecially in and about matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the greateſt concernment of our publick Weal. Courage and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs therein, is the peculiar Excellency of a <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtracy,</hi> the regular exerciſe thereof, will be the Strength and Glory of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Stability and Proſperity of this people under it. It is your Concernment to uphold this Government, in the full and whole intereſt and influence of it, unto all the Ends of it; eſpecially this great and main End of it, the <hi>Preſervation and Propogation of Religion.</hi> It will be your Commendation, which was holy <hi>Davids,</hi> as he was eminently a Type of Chriſt in the Work of Reformation, that the <hi>Zeal of Gods houſe had conſumed him.</hi> The hearts of the ſober, faithful, peaceable, and religious people of the Land, are <hi>towards the Governours of Iſrael, who offer themſelves willingly to the help of the Lord</hi> in the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this time of general defection. And ſurely, this is the greateſt Truſt that we repoſe in you, and therefore the higheſt hope, expectation, confidence and dependance that we place upon you, as our <hi>Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, Leaders, Publick Benefactors</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> That you will by the utmoſt improvement of your Power and Intereſt, advance and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the true, pure and holy Worſhip of God, (and ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you) not ſuffer theſe Churches, no not this <hi>People,</hi> to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, no not this <hi>Land,</hi> to be polluted and defiled with Will-worſhip. A <hi>Religious Reforming Magiſtracy,</hi> hath hither unto been our <hi>Crowning Mercy:</hi> if God ſet You over us in mercy, he will make you ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy. And therefore our Prayers for you ſhall ever be, That he that is <hi>the Light of Iſrael,</hi> will be a Light unto you, that you may be as <hi>the Light of Iſrael</hi> unto us. And that you may be abundantly influenced with a Spirit of Government, from Him whoſe all Government is; that you may receive a large portion of that Spirit, which reſteth upon Him, even <hi>a Spirit of Wiſdome and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, a Spirit of Counſel and of Might, a Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; that you may be of a quick underſtanding in his fear:</hi> And that in your meaſure alſo, <hi>Righteouſneſs may be the girdle of your loins, and Faithfulneſs the

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall take leave to propoſe this Exhortation unto the <hi>Miniſtry of theſe Churches,</hi> nextly concerned, as Publick Reformers, in the Work of Reformation. It is propoſed in the Text, directly, <hi>To the Angel of the Church of Epheſus.</hi> The Angels of the Churches are particularly directed unto, and charged with this Work, in the ſeveral Churches. The <hi>firſt Miniſtry</hi> of theſe Churches, it was eminently a <hi>Reforming Miniſtry,</hi> extraordinarily qualified unto, and improved in, the Work of Reformation: God made them great <hi>Reformers,</hi> and wrought a great Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> by them; and they lived faithfully labouring in that Work unto the death, though not without ſome diſcouragement, and ſome diminution of their joy and comfort, from a prae-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yea from ſome preſent appearance of the ſad ſigns of the defection of theſe Churches, before their departure. That Miniſtry, <hi>thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> they are generally departed; (ſome few (here and there one, onely) of that Ancient <hi>Old England-Miniſtry,</hi> remaining with us, as the Crown and Ornament of our <hi>New-England-Presbytery.</hi>) And truly, the remembrance of the departure of that Miniſtry, with the ſignal Circumſtances, and ſaid Conſequences thereof, may juſtly move lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; they being divers of them carried away (as it were) in <hi>Chariots of ſire:</hi> I mean, by an Anticipation of their tranſlation, in the ordinary

Their Praiſe is yet freſh and flouriſhing in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, being legible in <hi>living Epiſtles of Commendation, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the living God.</hi> They have a living <hi>Memory,</hi> and a laſting <hi>Monument</hi> in every godly heart, who hath experienced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, quickning, comforting preſence and power of the Spirit in their Miniſtration. They are departed, and we have <hi>wept over their faces</hi> with that Lamentation, <hi>My father, my father, the Chariots of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the Horsmen thereof.</hi> The Burthen of the Work of the Miniſtry, and ſo of this great Work of Reformation in theſe Churches, it now reſteth upon you, who are the preſent ſtanding Miniſtry, this <hi>New-England Miniſtry,</hi> which is Coaevall and Coaetaneous with this <hi>New-England Generation;</hi> Amongſt whom, I am not worthy to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one (though with the utmoſt expreſſion of diminution, as leſs then the leaſt of thoſe whom God hath called forth to take a part of this Miniſtry) and therefore moſt unmeet and unworthy thus to ſpeak unto you: yet I am bold to beſeech you to bear this Exhortation from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe Name I ſpeak, and ſay, O <hi>Labour to be a Reforming Miniſtry.</hi> Although there hath been a change of Miniſters in moſt of the Churches, yet we hope there is not a change of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but that the ſame Miniſtry is ſtill remaining; that is, a Miniſtry of the ſame Conſtitution, Spirit, Principles, Minde, Judgement and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, in all things pertaining to the Work of the Miniſtry in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; a Miniſtry, which hath received not onely <hi>the Mantle,</hi> but a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Spirit of Elijah.</hi> And therefore, you are engaged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, to uphold, and to carry on the ſame Work of Reformation, in all the parts of it, and to labour unto the progreſs of it, in the Spirit and Power of it, ſo far as you are concerned, reſpecting either Doctrine, Profeſſion or Practiſe. More eſpecially, God expecteth that you ſhould promote the Work of Reformation, in your ſeveral Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, by the regular and thorough exerciſe of the Power of Chriſt (committed unto you) in the Adminiſtration of Doctrine and Worſhip, which is the great Truſt and Charge committed unto you to keep, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. This is <hi>the Rod of his ſtrength out of Zion,</hi> whereby his people are made a <hi>willing people in the day of his power,</hi> Pſal. 110.2, 3. Exalt Chriſt, by the due exerciſe of his Power in his Name; that Chriſt may reign Miniſterially in theſe Churches. The Rule and Government
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64014:22"/>of Chriſt powerfully Adminiſtred, would ſoon Reform all. O that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline might be reſtored, unto the full and effectual exerciſe of it, in the Spirit and Power of it, unto all the ſaving Ends of it, in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches! it would work a great Reformation. And O that this poor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which is committed Chiefly to the Charge of this Miniſtry, may be generally cared for in all the Churches. They are the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you are called to labour with and for, amongſt whom you hope to have the fruit of your Labours in the Work of the Miniſtry, and whom you are to ſtand in Judgement with, and to give an account of, in the day of Account. O what Account will be given of them, if many, or the generality of them, ſhould periſh, under the neglect of the due exerciſe of the Miniſterial Power of Chriſt towards them, in any of the Churches? Moſt of all the Work of Reformation, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the faithful and ſucceſsful Labours of this Miniſtry, in the work of Converſion; the travail of your Souls in that work, your travailing with Souls in that work of Converſion. Here lyes the ſtreſs, and the life and ſpirit of the Work of Reformation; without which, all Eſſayes, Endeavours, and Labour therein, and thereunto, will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vain and void. If God make this Miniſtry a <hi>Converting Miniſtry;</hi> the Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> will be again revived; but if God ſuffer it to be a <hi>Judicial Miniſtry,</hi> a Miniſtry ſent in Judgement, <hi>to make the heart of this people fat</hi> — then there will be no hope, the Generation will grow ſick at heart, under <hi>Spiritual Plagues and Judgements,</hi> under <hi>a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death,</hi> by this Miniſtry, and ſo die in their ſins. <hi>A Judicial Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry hath alwayes been the fatall Cauſe of the finall Ruine of ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. And therefore, how are all ſuch, who have the Charge of Souls in ſuch a dangerous time, amongſt a declining people, concerned to Labour, to Pray, to Preach, to be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, in private, in publick, to ſpend their Souls, to bend the ſtrength of their Miniſterial Labours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Converſion of Souls? How did the Prophets of old labour, in like eaſe, with a declining people, and dolefully lament the loſs of their labour; ſo <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa 49.4. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 6.10. yea, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, — how often would I have gathered thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>— Truly, it is a moſt doleful diſcouragement to the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, in many Congregations, to ſee ſo many Souls fatting, hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, immortal Souls dying and periſhing under their hand, Care and Charge; but yet they muſt labour, and Agonize in Prayer unto God, for a diſpenſation of Converting grace by their Miniſtry, that the Work of Converſion, and ſo the Work of Reformation, may be revived: for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64014:22"/>if not, it is much to be feared, that <hi>the Sun</hi> will quickly <hi>go down over the Prophets:</hi> I allude unto <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.6. — I mean, that our day of grace will expire, and <hi>the Sun ſet upon theſe Churches,</hi> by the departure of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrv, and ſo <hi>our houſe be left unto us deſolate,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.38, 39. The Proſperity of theſe Churches, dependeth much upon the ſucceſs of the Labours of this preſent Miniſtry: and therefore, the hopes, deſires, and prayers of all the faithful people of God in theſe Churches are, That you may alwayes remain as <hi>Stars in the right hand of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> fixed in your Orb, full of Light, Regular in all your Motions, Powerfull in all your Influences, ſhining in all your Appearances, with the Splendor and Luſtre of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in whoſe hand you are: And that there may be no ſuch <hi>Wandering Stars,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Jude</hi> v. 13. whoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratick Motions ſhould diſturb the Coeleſtial Order and Harmony of our Eccleſiaſtical Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I propoſe this Exhortation alſo unto <hi>All the People of the Land,</hi> who are preſent; and O that <hi>whole New-England</hi> might be moved with this word of Exhortation,—<hi>Repent, and do the firſt works.</hi> O that the heart of this people might be moved, as the heart of one man, unto the Work of <hi>Reformation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> It is a general work, our <hi>defection</hi> it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and therefore our Reformation it muſt be alſo <hi>general.</hi> Of old, the Work of Reformation it was alwayes wrought by all the people, as you may reade 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.30. the Text ſaith there, <hi>All, ſmall and great:</hi> So <hi>Ezra</hi> 109. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.1. — <hi>All the the people as one man;</hi> every one that is able to do any thing; muſt bear his part in the Work of Reformation. Every one hath a particular work of Reformation, in and for himſelf, to Reform himſelf, his own heart, and his own life; if every one could Reform one, it would be a great and general Reformation. Every one, that hath a Soul to ſave, or hath any care of his Salvation, is concerned in this Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of what degree, rank or order whatſoever; every one muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in his own perſon, in his proper place, by the utmoſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power, intereſt and influence, to help forward the work; every one muſt ſet his hand and heart unto the Work of Reformation, in Families, Towns, Churches, throughout the Country. The Work of Reformation, it muſt run through all our hearts and wayes, in every Station and Relation, in every Calling and Imployment, through all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both Civil and Religious, in all our converſe with God and man. There is not one here preſent in the Congregation, but is concerned in this Work of Reformation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let every one be admoniſhed and warned to take heed of hindering the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64014:23"/>Work of Reformation.</hi> They are the moſt dangerous and deſperate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto <hi>New-England,</hi> and unto theſe Churches, who do hinder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; ſo do all Profane perſons, by their ſins of Profaneneſs, whoſe work it is more and more to corrupt the Generation, and to fill, and pollute the Land with their Abominations. So alſo do all Worldly and Self-ſeeking perſons, by ſinking the Intereſt of Religion, and raiſing a Worldly Intereſt, and ſo building up their own Self-intereſts upon the ruines of the Publick. So alſo do all Factious, Seditious, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, who make it their deſign and work to foment Diviſions, and to uphold dividing Parties and Intereſts, unto the ſhaking of very Foundations. So alſo do all corrupt Worſhippers, and corrupters of the Worſhip of God. In a word, ſo do all Carnal, Formal, Hypocritical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. And ſo do all the Capital leading ſinners of the Times, and of the Generation. Theſe are all publick Enemies unto theſe Churches—more dangerous and deſtructive Enemies unto this great Work of the Lord, then <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and the reſt of old, were unto the Building of the City or the Temple. <hi>Wo to thoſe by whom Offences come,</hi> who are Leaders in our great and general Defection, and hinderers of the Work of <hi>Reformation. As for ſuch who turn aſide unto their crooked wayes, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace ſhall be upon Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 125.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let all the Friends, Lovers, Well-wiſhers, Well-willers unto the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good and Proſperity of theſe Churches, up and be doing in the Work of Reformation.</hi> You who are of the <hi>paſſing generation,</hi> of the firſt undertakers of this Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſurviving, and who have ſeen with your eyes, and <hi>told us, what works God did in your dayes,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1. who have therefore yet a living remembrance of the gracious Wayes, and glorious Works of God to his people, in the firſt beginnings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous progreſs of the Work of <hi>Reformation;</hi> and ſo of the Houſe of God, of the Churches here in their <hi>firſt glory,</hi> Hag. 2.3. You have alſo ſeen and obſerved, the gradual declenſion and defection of theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and therefore you cannot chuſe but be moſt ſadly and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſenſible of our preſent neceſſity of <hi>Reformation.</hi> O then be moved to do what in you lyeth, by your Faith, Prayer, Life and Example, to revive the Work of Reformation again before you die. You alſo who are the preſent <hi>ſtanding Generation,</hi> the next and immediate Succeſſors unto thoſe <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> who have been actually betruſted with Church-Order, Ordinances, and Adminiſtrations, with the whole Cauſe of God, Kingdome of Chriſt, and Intereſt of Religion, and ſo with this great and glorious Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and who are likely to be found
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64014:23"/>moſt guilty of this general defection, and have too much already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the loſs of all; O be you moved to ſtand up ſtrongly unto the work under that Charge, and all thoſe ſolemn Obligations and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God hath laid upon you, the weight and burthen of the Work lyeth upon you: we have been raiſed up <hi>in the ſtead of our Fathers,</hi> as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.7. to carry on this Work. And truly, if we ſhould deſert, or be ſlight and negligent therein, it will ſoon fall to the ground, and ſink paſt recovery, and we ſhall thereby, at once, cut off the hope of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and lay the Foundation of the Ruine of <hi>Succeeding Generations,</hi> utterly <hi>undo</hi> all Poſterity. O let us therefore make it our Prayer, which is in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.57, 58. <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers; let him not leave us, nor forſake us, that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. And you who are of the Riſing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Adult Youth, and Young men, You are many of you, if not moſt of you a <hi>Third Generation,</hi> from thoſe whom God firſt brought out into this Wilderneſs; You are they who are likely to out-live <hi>Joſhua, and all the Elders of Iſrael that out-lived Joſhua—and all that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it is ſaid of them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. You cannot (many of you) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the works which God wrought for your forefathers—You have never ſeen theſe Churches in their firſt Beauty and Glory, nor the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of God in their firſt Spiritual Power and Purity: It hath been, ſo far, your unhappineſs, that you have been brought forth, and lived under the decaying ſtate of theſe Churches, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and therefore are like to grow up under the prevailing power of a Spirit of Apoſtacy. And alas! upon you is likely to fall all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and Miſery of this Apoſtacy which is begun, you will ſee and feel the ſad and lamentable Effects of it. O therefore that Youth and Young perſons, could lay this Conſideration unto their hearts; and be moved alſo, to engage in this Work of Reformation, before it be too late, by labouring unto a ſound Converſion, and a religious Converſation, in the dayes of their Youth. O that All thus concerned would <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and be doing!</hi>— True it is, there are many great diſcouragements, ſo that the hearts of thoſe who are moſt, and beſt diſpoſed unto the Work, are ready to fail; eſpecially conſidering, that all means of Reformation have hither unto failed, nothing hath hither unto done us any good: So that God himſelf may juſtly complain of us, as he did of that people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.29. — <hi>the bellows are burnt</hi>— Truly <hi>Reformation,</hi> it is likely to prove a very hard and heavy Work, yet we muſt never deſpair of Reformation, as that people ſeemed to do, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>If our tranſgreſſions and our iniquities be upon us, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64014:24"/>we pine away in them, how then ſhould we live?</hi> (q.d.) You call us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Reformation, and denounce Wrath and Judgement againſt us, if we do not do it; but alas, to what purpoſe? for God is reſolved to ſuffer us to pine and die away in our ſins: And therefore God doth inſtantly give them an encouraging call to Repentance and Reformation, Ver. 11. <hi>Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn— and live: Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Surely, God is yet calling of us unto <hi>Reformation,</hi> and waiting upon us for Reformation. It is yet a Probation-time with us, wherein we are ſtanding before God upon our Tryal; God hath repented once more of the evil, as <hi>Amos</hi> 7.3. the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Tree hath one year more to ſtand in the Vineyard, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.8. Yet truly, now God ſeemeth to be limitting of us to a certain day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7— <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> O let us take heed then unto this day, this limited day, which will put a period unto Gods patience and long-ſuffering, leſt God ſwear ſuddenly, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revecably, in his wrath, againſt us: if once our day be paſt, it will be indeed too late; witneſs our Saviours mournful, doleful Lamentation, which he wept out over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 19.42. <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things of thy peace; but now they are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from thine eyes.</hi> And why? ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation;</hi> therefore I ſay now, now, it is high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. It is preſſed as a preſent, as an inſtant duty, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Before—before—before—before;</hi> that is, in all haſte, ſpeedily. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to ſeek the Lord;</hi> (that is) it is high time, more then time, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time; now if ever, now or never. I do now re-inforce the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, at leaſt by way of alluſion to that in <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Yet now be ſtrong, O Zerubbabel, and be ſtrong, O Joſhua, the ſon of Joſedech the high Prieſt, and be ſtrong all ye people of the Land, ſaith the Lord, and work, for I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, according to the word that I Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with you, when you came out of Egypt, ſo my Spirit remaineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, fear ye not.</hi> So let Magiſtracy, Miniſtry and People be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and encouraged to this Work, believing and hoping that Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit remaineth among us, according to the Covenant which he made with his people, when he brought them forth firſt into this Wilderneſs. Now we muſt ſet to the Work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>With one heart.</hi> No hope of <hi>Reformation</hi> without <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Diviſion hath been one great cauſe of our-defection, and will be a total obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto <hi>Reformation,</hi> if it continue; we muſt unite our hearts, our hands, our ſtrength. O if ever we would unite, let it be in, and unto the Work of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64014:24"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Set unto it with all your hearts, and with all your ſouls.</hi> Our very hearts and ſouls muſt be engaged unto it, and in it, we muſt ſet to it in good earneſt, as unto a work that muſt be done; we are now brought unto this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either a <hi>timely, ſpeedy, thorough Reformation, or elſe there will be a general and total defection;</hi> either, <hi>Repent, and do the firſt works, or otherwiſe I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of its place, except thou repent,</hi> is the voice of Chriſt unto theſe Churches. O that we underſtood, and ſeriouſly and ſolemnly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that we are a loſt and undone people without Reformation; that we are a helpleſs, hopeleſs people without Reformation; that nothing will recover us from our defection, and prevent our deſtruction by the execution of impending Judgements, but onely Reformation. O then, we ſhould ſtand <hi>trembling</hi> before God, under the apprehenſion of the inſtant, urgent neceſſity of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.9. <hi>And all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſate in the ſtreet of the houſe of God, trembling becauſe of this matter</hi>— ver. 12. <hi>Then all the Congregation anſwered, and ſaid, with a loud voice, As thou haſt ſaid, ſo muſt we do.</hi> Obſerve, they cried out, paſſionately, affectionately, <hi>So muſt we do;</hi> (q.d.) we are a loſt, undone people, there is no hope, no help for us without Reformation: and then they ſet to the Work in good earneſt. O that we could make Reformation our main work and buſineſs, without delay.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt ſet to it with a right and full underſtanding of the whole work of Reformation, in the parts and progreſs of it.</hi> We have been ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn (by way of retortion) unto this great Exhortation, as that people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Even from the dayes of your fathers, ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them: Return unto me, and I will return unto you, ſaith the Lord: but ye ſaid, Wherein ſhall we return?</hi> So 8, 13. Though they were guilty of a very great and general defection, yet they underſtood not the Work of Reformation. Truly ſo it is our great unhappineſs, that we do no better know wherein the Work of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> conſiſteth; yea, that ſome of the great things of our peace do ſeem to be even Judicially, or in Judgement, hidden from our eyes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, unto this day;</hi> and that was the reaſon that their defection was continued. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10. <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved with this Generation, and ſaid, It is a people that do erre in their heart, and they have not known my wayes: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom I ſware,</hi> &amp;c. They were incurable in their defection, becauſe they underſtood not the Work of Reformation. It is obſervable, in all theſe ſeven Epiſtles unto the Churches, Chriſt calls for an underſtanding attention, <hi>Let him that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64014:25"/>hath an ear to hear, hear,</hi> &amp;c. There is much wiſdome and prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite unto the Work of Reformation: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Who is wiſe, he ſhall underſtand theſe things; prudent, he ſhall know them? for the wayes of the Lord are right, and the juſt ſhall walk in them</hi>— O! a want of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prudence, is one great hinderance: we do not, we will not underſtand the way and work of Reformation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We muſt ſet unto the Work in a way of full and ſincere ſubjection unto Order, and carry on the Work according to Rules of Order.</hi> Breach of Order, neglect of Order, <hi>Non ſubjection unto Order,</hi> Diſorder, and Confuſion, it hath been one great Cauſe, yea it is <hi>a great part of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> and if ever we do hope, or intend to make thorough work in <hi>Reformation,</hi> we muſt recover Order, the Beauty, the Harmony, the Peace and Tranquility, the Regularity, the Purity and Simplicity, the Power and Efficacy, Life and Spirit of Order, Goſpel-order, the Order which Chriſt hath ſet and appointed in his Church. Although we may have never ſo good diſpoſitions, intentions, reſolutions, and deſires unto the Work of Reformation, yet if we purſue it not in due Order, it will all come to nothing, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13— <hi>becauſe we ſought him not in the due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>— Surely, there is no caſe ſo difficult among us, but there is a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and eaſie way to an iſſue, if we will acknowledge, and apply, and follow up Rules of Order, in the due improvement of them; if we would be ſet down by Order, be ruled and governed by Order: but if we will ſlight, neglect, reject, contemn, and deſpiſe Order, we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but Diſorder and Confuſion, and ſhall be in great danger thereby to run and ruſh deſperately into our own ruine. It was the great Expedient which the Apoſtle propoſeth, for the Reformation of that diſtracted Church of <hi>Corinth, Let all things be done decently, and in order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33, 40. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We muſt ſet our ſelves to the work with a fervent love unto, and zeal for the work it ſelf.</hi> The Cauſe of God, the Kingdome of Chriſt, the Proſperity of theſe Churches, ſo much concerned in it; this is the onely true Principle and Spirit of Reformation. O that our firſt <hi>New-England Zeal and Love</hi> might be revived and raiſed, under a full, clear diſcovery of the Spiritual Beauty and Glory of that Work, and of that Cauſe, that we may labour in it, in the heart, height, and ſtrength of that Zeal and Love. This will indeed Spirit the Work, and Spirit us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. It is a ſign, that there is a glorious work of Reformation near, when Gods people <hi>do love the ſtones, and favour the duſt of Zion,</hi> Pſal. 102.14.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>We muſt labour in it, under a ſenſe of our own utter inſufficiency to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64014:25"/>Reform, renouncing all our own carnal Confidences,</hi> and diſclaiming our own wiſdomes and wills, wherein we have too long laboured in vain; truſt our own hearts no further, no longer, which have ſo much, &amp; ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, but bemoan our ſelves before God, as a hopeleſs and helpleſs people, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. and the Church, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23 — <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God. Truly, in vain is ſalvation hoped for, from the hills, or from the multitude of mountains, — for ſhame hath devoured the labours of our hands from our youth— We lie dwon in our ſhame, and confuſion covereth us</hi>—then God will work for us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his people, and repent himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſeeth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or leſt.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.15, 17. <hi>Why crieſt thou for thine affliction? thy ſorrow is incurable— for I will reſtore health unto thee, I will heal thee of thy wounds</hi>— We muſt therefore make our Prayer to God, <hi>Turn thou us, and we ſhall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>Heal thou us, and we ſhall be healed,</hi> Jer. 17.14.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>We muſt labour in this Work by Faith.</hi> Thoſe who will be (at leaſt) Publick Reformers, muſt have a mighty power of Faith, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.8. <hi>He took courage, and put away the abominable Idols.</hi> There muſt be the confidence of Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.15. <hi>In returning and in reſt ſhall ye be ſaved, in quietneſs and confidence ſhall be your ſtrength.</hi> There muſt be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of Faith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>Come, let us return to the Lord— he will heal us— he will binde us up— he will revive us— he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> There muſt be the hope and expectation of Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. —<hi>in the way of thy judgements have we waited for thee</hi>— ver. 12. <hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> There muſt be the ſtrong and powerful interceſſions of Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6.7. <hi>He hath ſet watchmen upon thy walls, O Jeruſalem— Ye that make mention of the Name of the Lord, give him no reſt untill he eſtabliſh, and make Jeruſalem the praiſe of the whole earth.</hi> There muſt be the wreſtlings of Faith, whereby we may take hold upon God, and not let him go, but hold him by Faith, as a God in Covenant with us, as a God All ſufficient unto us, as a God who hath engaged himſelf unto us by his Covenant, and by all his Promiſes, to pardon us, to purge us, to convert us, to heal us. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 32.11, 13, 32. Thus alſo the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8, 9. O now, if ever, is the time for all thoſe who have Faith, to improve their Faith unto the utmoſt, for the publick good of this poor people, and the proſperity of theſe Churches. Faith will do much in this great work, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. —<hi>hear me, O Judah, and all ye inhabitants of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64014:26"/>Jeruſalem, believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed; believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, O that we underſtood, that it is God himſelf, <hi>our Fathers God,</hi> yea <hi>God even our own God,</hi> our good, gracious, merciful, faithful, and All-ſufficient God, that God who hath nouriſhed us, and brought us up as Children; O it is he that is now teſtifying unto us, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, to return unto him by Repentance and Reformation, (to ſpeak with reverence of God, after the manner of men.) Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions are <hi>moving,</hi> his bowels are <hi>ſounding,</hi> his <hi>repentings</hi> are kindling, his <hi>heart is turning within him,</hi> towards <hi>New-England,</hi> towards this poor Generation; though he hath many times, and many wayes ſpoken againſt us, yet he doth <hi>earneſtly remember us ſtill;</hi> he remembreth the kindneſs of our youth— when <hi>New-England</hi> was Holineſs to the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee,</hi> (or as in the Margin.) <hi>For thy ſake I remember;</hi> though we have forgotten that firſt love and kindneſs unto God, yet for our ſakes God doth remember the love and kindneſs which our Fathers bare unto him; the very remembrance of it doth move him to expreſs ſome love and kindneſs unto us their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the remembrance of it, hath hither unto ſtayed the hand of his divine Juſtice: So that he is even ready to fay of us, as of them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim?</hi>— Surely God ſheweth himſelf even loth to give us up. And therefore after all our backſlidings, unworthy, ſinful, ſhameful carriages, evil requitals, high provocations of him, whereby we have ſo much grieved and wearied him; yea, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he hath been entring into Judgement with us, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from us, yet he is after all, now at laſt, ſtill calling and crying after us, <hi>Return, ye back-ſliding children, for I am married unto you: Return; O back ſliding children, I will heal your back-ſlidings,</hi> Jer. 3.12, 22. Yea let me ſay further, It is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf that calls, it is he that ſtands at the doors of theſe Churches, and knocks, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. that he may return, come in, and repleniſh theſe Churches with a fulneſs of his Preſence, by his Spirit and Grace. It is the voice of <hi>our Beloved that knocked, ſaying, Open unto me, my Love,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4. O it is Chriſt, who is ſolliciting for the renewing of our firſt love unto him as our Beloved; yea, <hi>our Beloved is yet putting in of his hand by the hole of the door,</hi> (i.e.) letting in ſuch Influences, and leaving ſuch Impreſſions of his love upon the Souls of his ſincere ones, as may move your bowels for him, that you may be throughly awakened to ariſe, and open unto him; and that after he hath waited without, ſo long, untill his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night. We are now
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64014:26"/>ſolemnly put to the queſtion, Whether we will yet return to the Lord our God, and whether we will yet open unto our Beloved? Surely then, we have cauſe moſt ſeriouſly and ſolemnly to deliberate upon this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Will we repent, and do our firſt works, yea or no? Will <hi>New-England</hi> return and Reform, yea or no? What return ſhall we make? what anſwer ſhall we give him? what ſhall we ſay unto God? thus expoſtulating in a way of grace and mercy with us. O ſhall we be ſo deſperate, as to reply with them, Jer. 2.25. —<hi>but thou ſaidſt, There is no hope; no, I have loved ſtrangers, and after them I will go.</hi> Jer. 18.12. <hi>And they ſaid, There is no hope; but we will walk after our own devices; we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</hi> Is there no hope? are we paſt hope of Reformation? Surely then, well may God make his Appeal from us, unto the Heaven and Earth, and enter into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with us, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth</hi>— Micah 6.3.—<hi>Hear, O Mountains, the Lords Controverſie: for the Lord hath a Controverſie with his people, he will plead with Iſrael, O my people, what have I done unto thee! wherein have I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt me: I brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt, and Redeemed thee out of the houſe of Bondage: I ſent before thee Moſes, Aaron, and Miriam.</hi> Truly, ſo may God plead with <hi>New-England,</hi> O my people, what have I done unto thee? Have I been unfaithful, inſufficient, unkinde, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, ungracious, unmerciful unto you? Have I ever failed, or fruſtrated your faith, hope, or expectations? Have I ever left you, or forſaken you, in any time of neceſſity, extremity, or danger? Have I ever been in jurious unto you? <hi>(q.d.)</hi> Charging me, charge me if you can, What iniquity have you found in me? Have not I ſeparated, and ſet apart your <hi>Fathers,</hi> as a peculiar people to my ſelf? Have not I nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>You,</hi> and brought you up as Children, brought you under my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſetled you in the poſſeſſion of my Houſe, Worſhip and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, protected you in the enjoyment and improvement of all my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and pleaſant things, carried you as upon Eagles wings, pitied you, pardoned you, ſpared you, and ſaved you, and ſuperadded Peace, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all temporal mercies? O fooliſh people and unwiſe, will you thus then requite the Lord your God? <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid, and be ye very diſolate, ſaith the Lord!</hi> O how will <hi>New-England</hi> be able to ſtand before the Lord, when he ſhall thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with us, and that in order unto the vindication of his Juſtice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unto the execution of his deſtroying and deſolating Judgements, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>But my people would not hearken unto my voice, and Iſrael would have none of me: ſo I gave them up.</hi> O we to <hi>New-England,</hi> when God comes to the parting blow with us. But muſt God and <hi>New-England</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64014:27"/>part thus? O God for bid! Why ſhould we not then, now ſtanding in the preſence of God, in our hearts, and with our Souls ſay, <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God— and take with us words, and ſay, Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly; for in thee the fatherleſs finde mercy.</hi> O with what open out-ſtretched Arms of mercy, would God receive and entertain his poor backfliding people, ſo returning to him? and ſay, I will heal their backſlidings, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from them. O how would God rejoice over poor returning <hi>New-England,</hi> and reſt with Divine delight and Complacency in his love unto us? O what a bleſſed, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Change, would ſuch a work of Reformation work in <hi>New-England?</hi> How would theſe Churches revive and flouriſh, and recover their firſt Beauty and Glory again? be repleniſhed with the gracious Preſence of God, and of Chriſt again; the Worſhip and Ordinances of God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto their Spiritual Power and Purity, and be accompanied in all Adminiſtrations, with a plentiful diſpenſation of Gods Spirit and Grace; Sinners be converted, Saints edified and comforted, in Communion with God, and one with another; the great and crying ſins of the Times ſuppreſſed, Holineſs both in heart and life increaſed; our Controverſies iſſued, Contentions ended, our Breaches and Loſſes repaired, out Wounds and Sickneſſes healed, Gods Covenant renewed and confirmed with us, and we in all reſpects made a bleſſed and happy people, in the full enjoyment and improvement of our moſt precious and pleaſant things! O then <hi>New-England</hi> would be <hi>New-England</hi> again. What a rejoicing would this be to the Churches of Chriſt? and what an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and advance to the Cauſe and Kingdome of Chriſt in the World? O if it pleaſe God to give us (in this our moſt hopeleſs and helpleſs eſtate) <hi>the valley of Achor for a door of hope,</hi> then ſhall <hi>N. E. ſing as in the dayes of her youth,</hi> as in the day when God firſt brought her forth into this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. Then ſhall all the lovers of <hi>Zion</hi> rejoice with us, and for us, with acclamations of Bleſſing, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.23. <hi>The Lord bleſs thee, O habitation of Juſtice, and mountain of Holineſs.</hi> It was a great refreſhing to this weary and weeping Prophet, to ſee Viſions of peace and proſperity unto the Church, and therefore he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this I awaked, and beheld, and my ſleep was ſweet unto me.</hi> O it is a ſweet and pleaſant thing, by faith and hope, to believe and hope for ſuch proſperity unto theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Let it ever be our Prayer, which was the Prayer of the Church, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.16, 17. <hi>Let thy work appear unto thy Servants, and thy glory unto their Children, and let the beauty of the Lord, our God be upon us: and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh thou the work of our hands upon us, yea the work of our hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi>
